<h3>Assessment Plan</h3>
<p>To nurture lifelong learners, the school-based assessments aim to nurture
the intrinsic motivation in our students to learn and reduce the over-inflation
of effort so as to ensure their well-being and a balanced approach to their
development.
<br>
<br>The assessment plans are as follows:
