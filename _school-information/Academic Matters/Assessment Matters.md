<h3>Assessment Plan</h3>
<p>To nurture lifelong learners, the school-based assessments aim to nurture
the intrinsic motivation in our students to learn and reduce the over-inflation
of effort so as to ensure their well-being and a balanced approach to their
development.
<br>
<br>The assessment plans are as follows:

<p>For Sec 1 to 3 students, Weighted Assessments (WAs) consisting of written
class tests, and alternative assessments such as online assignments, projects
and practical tests will be conducted in Term 1, 2 and 3.</p>
<p><em>*Semestral-based subjects e.g., D&amp;T and FCE will follow subject-specific assessment plans.</em>

<p>WA Schedule will be released via SLS and Parents Gateway from the Week
3 of Term 1 and Week 2 of Terms 2 and 3.
<br>
<br>Their results will be reported in the form of progress reports and result
slips.</p>
<h3>Promotion Criteria</h3>
<p>Secondary 1 and 2 [2025]</p>
<p>Throughout their secondary school education, students can take subjects
at three subject levels, known as G1, G2 and G3. Students will have the
flexibility to adjust their subject levels at appropriate junctures, based
on their strengths, interests and learning needs. Students will subsequently
access different courses and post-secondary pathways based on their various
subjects and subject level combinations.</p>
