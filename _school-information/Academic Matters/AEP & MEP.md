<h3>Art/Music Elective Programme (AEP/MEP) For Secondary One Students In Non-AEP/MEP Schools</h3>
<p>From 2016, in line with MOEâ€™s approach to grow the potential and talent
of students across a wider range of domains, students were given more opportunities
to enrol in art and music talent development programmes at the secondary
level.</p>
<p>With the diversity of talents among our students, there may be students
with passion and talent for art or music who are not enrolled in the schools
that host the Art Elective Programme (AEP) or Music Elective Programme
(MEP). To support these students, MOE has appointed three schools as AEP
or MEP centres which will accept students from other schools.</p>
<p>Secondary 1 students in non-AEP/MEP schools who are passionate and show
potential and talent in art or music can apply to these AEP/MEP centres.</p>
