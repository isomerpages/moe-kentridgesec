Dear Parents/Guardians,

A warm welcome on your child's/ward's posting to Kent Ridge Secondary School!

Please note that in view of the COVID-19 situation, posted students **do not need** to physically report to the school on 23 December 2021.

The school will be using **Parents Gateway (PG)** to communicate with you useful information on how to prepare your child/ward for the first day of school.

For parents who are not onboard PG, please refer to this [link](/school-information/parents-gateway/onboarding/) for onboarding instructions. For parents who are unable to onboard PG (eg. not eligible for Singpass), the school will reach out to you via email.

For your child's/ward's **2022 Sec 1 Class allocation**, you will be able to check via **Parents Gateway** from 23 December 2021.

To find out more about the school, you may also like to visit our [e-OPEN HOUSE 2021](https://kentridgesec.moe.edu.sg/news-events/e-open-house-2021/) webpage and view a school tour video on our school [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/kentridgesec).
