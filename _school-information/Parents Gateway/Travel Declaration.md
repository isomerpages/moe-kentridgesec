### TRAVEL DECLARATION FOR SCHOOL HOLIDAYS

Dear Parents, to safeguard your child’s health and that of all students and staff in the school, kindly declare any travel plans you may have for the upcoming school holidays.

Declare Travel Plans in Parents Gateway (PG):

1.  Download and install the latest version of the Parents Gateway app.
2.  Go to \[SERVICES\] > \[DECLARE TRAVELS\] to make your declaration.

If you have more than 1 child, and the declarations details are the same, please select all of them and make only 1 declaration, even if they are in different schools.

You can also make a 'Not Travelling' declaration if necessary.

Only one parent is required to declare.

Thank you for providing travel information to help the school to be prepared for travel safety and emergencies.
