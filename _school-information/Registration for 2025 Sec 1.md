<p>Dear Parents/Guardians,</p>
<p>A warm welcome on your child’s/ward’s posting to Kent Ridge Secondary
School!</p>
<p>Please note that students do not need to report to their posted secondary
schools upon receiving their <u>S1 posting results</u>.</p>
<p>The school will be using Parents Gateway (PG) to communicate with you
useful information on how to prepare your child/ward for the first day
of school.</p>
<p>Your child’s/ward’s <strong>2025 Sec 1 Class allocation</strong> will be <strong>available on</strong> Parents
Gateway after <strong>12 noon on 19 December 2024 (Thursday)</strong>.</p>
<p>As there may be student movement due to transfer cases, we seek your understanding
that there may be changes in the Form Class allocation. All Form Class
allocation will only be finalised after the school term begins.</p>
<p>You will also be notified via Parents Gateway if your child/ ward is eligible
to offer core subjects under SBB at a more demanding level, or Higher Mother
Tongue Languages HCL/HML. Please check the SBB and MTL sections below for
more information.</p>
<p>Do ensure books for the correct subject level are purchased for your child/ward.
If unsure, you may purchase textbooks in the first week of school.</p>
