The Student Health Advisor (SHA) Programme is developed by the Ministry of Health (MOH) and fully supported by the Ministry of Education (MOE). Through this Programme, MOE and MOH aim to identify health-related issues faced by your child/ward early, so that timely intervention can be carried out where appropriate.

The SHA will be stationed in your child’s/ward’s school to provide advice on health issues. The SHA (only with Nursing background) will also identify and counsel students with existing chronic medical conditions who may be non-compliant with treatment and appropriately refer them to adolescent health services, if necessary. Students may be referred to the SHA by School Personnel, School Health Service teams, and the Health Sciences Authority.  Students can also visit the SHA on a walk-in basis.

Should you prefer that your child/ward not participate in the SHA programme, please inform the school’s teacher-in-charge.
