Kent Ridge Secondary School is committed to providing a student-centric and values-driven education to all our students. We recognise our students’ potential and talents in both academic and non-academic areas and develop them holistically through our programmes. In line with this, we are offering DSA for students who have the talents in Badminton, Basketball, Floorball and Computational Thinking Skills.

The DSA scheme, introduced in 2004, provides students with the opportunity to seek admission to a secondary school, based on a diverse range of academic and non-academic achievements and talents that they can demonstrate beyond the PSLE.

Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop the area of talent.
