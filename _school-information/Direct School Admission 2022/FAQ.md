<h5 style="color:black" align="center">Is there a minimum requirement?</h5>

Students eligible must qualify for the Express or Normal (Academic) or Normal (Technical) course based on MOE’s admission criteria.

<h5 style="color:black" align="center">How many places can Kent Ridge Secondary School offer in this DSA-Sec Exercise?</h5>

Our school may offer up to a maximum of 20% of the total Secondary 1 intake for the year.

<h5 style="color:black" align="center">Will my child/ward be part of the associated if he/she is successful in the respective DSA-Sec application?</h5>

Yes, your child/ward will be automatically channelled into the Infocomm Club as his/her CCA through the DSA - Sec Exercise if he/she has applied via DSA - Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (Computational Thinking Skills) or Badminton/Basketball/Floorball if he/she has applied via DSA – Sports and Games. Hence, your child/ward will not be involved in the CCA Selection Process during the Sec 1 CCA Orientation Week.

<h5 style="color:black" align="center">Does my child/ward have to take PSLE after receiving a Confirmed Offer or been placed on the waiting list?</h5>

Students who take up Confirmed Offers or are placed on Waiting List by schools during the DSA-Sec Exercise are still required to take the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE). Those who take up Confirmed Offers are guaranteed a place in the school that has extended them an offer, provided that their PSLE results meet the **minimum** requirement for a course \[Express / Normal (Academic) /Normal (Technical)\] offered by the school.

<h5 style="color:black" align="center">Can my child/ward apply for transfer after accepting the Confirmed Offer from DSA-Sec school?</h5>

Similar to previous years, students who have been admitted to a school through the DSA-Sec Exercise will not be able to participate in the centralised Secondary One Posting Exercise.

Students who have been successfully allocated to a school via the DSA-Sec Exercise are expected to honour their commitment to their posted DSA-Sec schools and will thus not be allowed to transfer to another school after the release of the PSLE results.
