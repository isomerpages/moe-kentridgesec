<p>
Through the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP), all secondary school students will own a school-prescribed Personal Learning Device (PLD). Secondary one students would be invited to purchase a school-prescribed PLD. Singapore Citizen students can use their Edusave Account to pay for the PLD.
<br><br>
The PLD will be used in tandem with the national e-learning platform – the Singapore Student Learning Space (“SLS”) – as well as other educational technology tools to personalise and enhance students’ learning. This will also enable students to acquire digital skills and apply these skills as they navigate an increasingly digitalised world.
<br><br>
