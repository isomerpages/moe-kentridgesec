Digital technology is becoming increasingly pervasive in jobs, workplaces and society. The NDLP was launched in March 2020 to make digital learning inclusive by equipping students with the digital literacies to be future-ready. Digital literacies better enable our students, at different stages of their education journey, to acquire the digital skills required to navigate the digital age through four mutually reinforcing components in the ‘Find, Think, Apply and Create’ framework.

Through the NDLP, all secondary school students will own a school-prescribed personal learning device (PLD) by the end of 2021. Singapore Citizen students can use their Edusave Account to pay for the PLD. The PLD will be used to facilitate an environment that encourages personalised learning.

			<p>In order to achieve the desired student outcomes described above, our school has put in place processes to support our students, staff and partners.</p>
			<p><img src="/images/NDLP4.png" alt="NDLP" style="width:65%"></p>
			<p>For instance, all Secondary One students are provided with weekly digital literacy lessons in semester 1 to support them in achieving baseline digital literacies. All students also have access to the digital literacy lessons in the SLS MOE community library. </p>

<p><strong>Financial Assistance</strong> </p>
<p>Students who are Singapore citizens can use their Edusave to pay partly or fully for the PLD. A Singapore citizen student can use up to the available Edusave balance in his/her Edusave account to pay for the PLD after setting aside provision for payment of 2nd tier miscellaneous fees. MOE provided a one-off Edusave top-up of $200 in 2020 to all eligible Singaporean students in primary and secondary schools. This was on top of the annual Edusave contribution of $290 for secondary students and $230 for primary students. Parents/guardians can also choose to pay cash for the PLD. Please note that it is compulsory for all existing students on the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme to use their Edusave to pay for the PLD, after subsidies have been granted.</p>
<p>Subsidies are available for students who require financial assistance to purchase a PLD. Students under the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme for the year will automatically be subsidized for the PLD. Students who are currently not under the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme may approach our school’s General Office or email <a href="mailto:krss@moe.edu.sg">krss@moe.edu.sg</a> to apply for additional subsidy if their Gross Household Income (GHI) is $4,000 or less, or Per Capita Income (PCI) is $1,000 or less. “PCI” refers to the Gross Household Income divided by the total number of family members in the household. </p>
<p><strong>Device Management Application (DMA)</strong></p>
<p>All PLDs will be pre-installed with a Device Management Application (DMA). The DMA software is installed in students’ PLDs to provide a safer digital learning environment, and to prevent misuse of the device.  The DMA has a variety of functions that will support the use of the PLD in the classroom, as well as safeguard students’ cyber-wellness. The DMA has 3 main components:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Classroom Management Service</strong>. This enables teachers to actively monitor and control students’ use of the PLD during lesson time to improve student management and deliver effective teaching. </li>
<li><strong>Mobile Device Management Service</strong>. This facilitates the remote deployment of teaching and learning applications and comes with security patches. The school may also leverage on the Mobile Device Management Service to install teaching and learning resources. </li>
<li><strong>Usage Management Service</strong>. This allows the school to address cyber-wellness concerns, such as excessive and inappropriate use of the PLD and manage prolonged use of the PLD to reduce stress on the eyes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Parents/guardians can choose between these 3 DMA After-School Parent Options to suit their preferences for managing the PLDs <strong>after school hours</strong>. Parents can request to change their choice of DMA option by submitting this form: <a href="http://go.gov.sg/krssdmaoptions">http://go.gov.sg/krssdmaoptions</a>. The request will be processed by the school <strong>at the end of every month</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/Slide2-225x300.jpg" alt="Device Management Application (DMA)" style="width:65%"></p>
<p><strong>Cyber-wellness</strong></p>
<p>The school has in place measures to enable a safe and seamless learning environment for students. Parents play a key role in partnering the school to support their child. </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Educating students on Cyber-Wellness and Digital Literacies</strong>. MOE has made significant changes to the Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) curriculum. Cyber-Wellness lessons will feature significantly in the CCE2021 lessons. Students will also continue to learn to be respectful, safe, and responsible users of technology through various student learning experiences.  </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Device Management Application (DMA)</strong>. The DMA plays an important role in helping the school to safeguard students’ cyber-wellness by:</p>
<ul>
<li>collecting data on usage by the student, such as the amount of time spent on each application, </li>
<li>monitoring, filtering and limiting the type of websites accessible to the student, and</li>
<li>placing restrictions on students’ screen time in order to prevent cyber addiction.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)</strong>. The AUP helps to establish a common understanding of what constitutes an acceptable and appropriate use of the PLD, so as to enable a conducive learning environment. Parents could refer to the AUP when helping to manage their child’s use of the PLD.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Roll-Out of IT Applications as part of the NDLP</strong></p>
<p>As part of the NDLP, schools will progressively roll out IT applications that will be vital to students’ learning experience and educational journey. The school will roll out some or all of the following applications:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Student</strong> <strong>iCON</strong>: Every secondary school student will be given an email address. This is a service provided by Google as part of Google Suite. </li>
<li><strong>Microsoft</strong> <strong>Pro Plus</strong>: Every secondary school student will be able to use Microsoft Office tools that include Word, PowerPoint and Excel. </li>
<li><strong>Zoom</strong>: Every secondary school student will be given a Zoom free account with a 40-min time limit using the Student iCON for the students’ video conferencing needs.</li>
</ul>
<p>  </p>
<p>Schools may also choose to roll out applications other than those listed above. The school will need to use your child’s/ward’s personal data such as his/her name and class to set up user accounts.</p>
