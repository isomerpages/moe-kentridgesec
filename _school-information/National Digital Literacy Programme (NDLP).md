<p>Digital technology is becoming increasingly pervasive in jobs, workplaces
and society. The NDLP was launched in March 2020 to make digital learning
inclusive by equipping students with the digital literacies to be future-ready.
Digital literacies better enable our students, at different stages of their
education journey, to acquire the digital skills required to navigate the
digital age through four mutually reinforcing components in the ‘Find,
Think, Apply and Create’ framework.</p>
<p>Through the NDLP, all secondary school students will own a school-prescribed
personal learning device (PLD) by the end of 2021. Singapore Citizen students
can use their Edusave Account to pay for the PLD. The PLD will be used
to facilitate an environment that encourages personalised learning.</p>

<p><strong>Use of Edusave</strong>
</p>
<p>Students who are Singapore citizens can use their Edusave to pay fully
or partly for the PLD, after setting aside provision for payment of miscellaneous
fees. Parents/Guardians can also choose to pay cash for the PLD. MOE has
provided Edusave top-ups of $200 in 2020 to 2022, and $300 in 2023 to all
eligible Singaporean students in primary and secondary schools. This is
on top of the annual Edusave contribution of $290 for secondary school
students and $230 for primary school students.</p>
<p><strong>Financial Assistance</strong>
</p>
<p>Subsidies are available for students who require funding support to purchase
a PLD. Please note that it is compulsory for all students on the MOE Financial
Assistance Scheme (FAS) to use their Edusave to pay for any remaining sums
due for the PLD, after subsidies have been granted. Please see the table
below for information on the eligibility for the subsidy:</p>

<p><strong>Device Management Application (DMA)</strong>
</p>
<p>All PLDs will be pre-installed with a Device Management Application (DMA).
The DMA software is installed in students’ PLDs to provide a safer digital
learning environment, and to prevent misuse of the device.&nbsp; The DMA
has a variety of functions that will support the use of the PLD in the
classroom, as well as safeguard students’ cyber-wellness. The DMA has 3
main components:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Classroom Management Service</strong>. This enables teachers to
actively monitor and control students’ use of the PLD during lesson time
to improve student management and deliver effective teaching.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mobile Device Management Service</strong>. This facilitates the
remote deployment of teaching and learning applications and comes with
security patches. The school may also leverage on the Mobile Device Management
Service to install teaching and learning resources.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Usage Management Service</strong>. This allows the school to address
cyber-wellness concerns, such as excessive and inappropriate use of the
PLD and manage prolonged use of the PLD to reduce stress on the eyes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Parents/guardians can choose between these 3 DMA After-School Parent Options
to suit their preferences for managing the PLDs&nbsp;<strong>after school hours</strong>.
Parents can request to change their choice of DMA option by submitting
this form: <a href="https://go.gov.sg/krparentdma" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://go.gov.sg/krparentdma</a>.
The request will be processed by the school&nbsp;<strong>at the end of every month</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Cyber-wellness</strong>
</p>
<p>The school has in place measures to enable a safe and seamless learning
environment for students. Parents play a key role in partnering the school
to support their child.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Educating students on Cyber-Wellness and Digital Literacies</strong>.&nbsp;MOE
has made significant changes to the Character and Citizenship Education
(CCE) curriculum. Cyber-Wellness lessons will feature significantly in
the CCE2021 lessons. Students will also continue to learn to be respectful,
safe, and responsible users of technology through various student learning
experiences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Device Management Application (DMA)</strong>. The DMA plays an
important role in helping the school to safeguard students’ cyber-wellness
by:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>collecting data on usage by the student, such as the amount of time spent
on each application,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>monitoring, filtering and limiting the type of websites accessible to
the student, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>placing restrictions on students’ screen time in order to prevent cyber
addiction.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)</strong>. The AUP helps to establish
a common understanding of what constitutes an acceptable and appropriate
use of the PLD, so as to enable a conducive learning environment. Parents
could refer to the AUP when helping to manage their child’s use of the
PLD.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Roll-Out of IT Applications as part of the NDLP</strong>
</p>
<p>As part of the NDLP, schools will progressively roll out IT applications
that will be vital to students’ learning experience and educational journey.
The school will roll out some or all of the following applications:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Student</strong>&nbsp;<strong>iCON</strong>: Every secondary school
student will be given an email address. This is a service provided by Google
as part of Google Suite.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Microsoft</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Pro Plus</strong>: Every secondary
school student will be able to use Microsoft Office tools that include
Word, PowerPoint and Excel.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Zoom</strong>: Every secondary school student will be given a
Zoom free account with a 40-min time limit using the Student iCON for the
students’ video conferencing needs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The school may also choose to roll out applications other than those listed
above. The school may need to use your child’s/ward’s personal data such
as his/her full name, class and Student iCON ID to set up user accounts.</p>
