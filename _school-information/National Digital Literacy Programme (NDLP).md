Digital technology is becoming increasingly pervasive in jobs, workplaces and society. The NDLP was launched in March 2020 to make digital learning inclusive by equipping students with the digital literacies to be future-ready. Digital literacies better enable our students, at different stages of their education journey, to acquire the digital skills required to navigate the digital age through four mutually reinforcing components in the ‘Find, Think, Apply and Create’ framework.

Through the NDLP, all secondary school students will own a school-prescribed personal learning device (PLD) by the end of 2021. Singapore Citizen students can use their Edusave Account to pay for the PLD. The PLD will be used to facilitate an environment that encourages personalised learning.
