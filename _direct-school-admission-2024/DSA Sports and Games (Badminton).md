Kent Ridge Secondary School will offer DSA to eligible students via Floorball, Badminton and Basketball. This is in line with our Learning for Life Programme which harnesses the philosophy of Olympism to develop our students through the interaction of mind, body and will.

**Background**

KR Badminton is a racquet sport played indoors. Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per side) and "doubles" (with two players per side). It is a sport that demands excellent fitness where players require&nbsp;aerobic stamina,&nbsp;agility, strength, speed, and precision. It is also a technical sport, requiring good&nbsp;motor coordination&nbsp;and the development of sophisticated racquet movements

Our CCA-Badminton curriculum is designed to nurture our students’ talents and potential to the fullest. This will encourage our students to develop a lifelong interest and passion that will sustain a healthy lifestyle.

Apart from building up the physical fitness, mental fortitude and game skills of our students, the badminton training sessions and co-curricular activities undergirded by the school values, are also good platforms for our students to develop positive character traits which will strengthen their 21st&nbsp;century competency skills and translate into positive attitudes and self-expressions.
