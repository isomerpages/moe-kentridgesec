Dear Parents/Guardians,  
  
A warm welcome on your child's/ward's posting to Kent Ridge Secondary School!  
  
Please note that students do not need to report to their posted secondary schools upon receiving their [S1 posting results](https://www.moe.gov.sg/news/press-releases/20231213-2023-secondary-1-posting-results).
  
The school will be using&nbsp;**Parents Gateway (PG)**&nbsp;to communicate with you useful information on how to prepare your child/ward for the first day of school.  
  
For your child's/ward's&nbsp;**2024 Sec 1 Class allocation**, you will be able to check via Parents Gateway from 21 December 2023, after 12 noon. Please note that the form class assigned to your child/ward is temporary and will be confirmed only after the school term begins. We seek your understanding, as we anticipate some transfer cases and student movement within the first few weeks of school.

For further clarification, please&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kentridgesec.moe.edu.sg/school-information/contact-information/">Contact Us</a>.

<p>
Through the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP), all secondary school students will own a school-prescribed Personal Learning Device (PLD). Secondary one students would be invited to purchase a school-prescribed PLD. Singapore Citizen students can use their Edusave Account to pay for the PLD.
<br><br>
The PLD will be used in tandem with the national e-learning platform – the Singapore Student Learning Space (“SLS”) – as well as other educational technology tools to&nbsp;personalise&nbsp;and enhance students’ learning. This will also enable students to acquire digital skills and apply these skills as they navigate an increasingly&nbsp;digitalised&nbsp;world.
