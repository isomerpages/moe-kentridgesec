### Release of 2024 GCE-O Level Examination Results
###
      
Dear Kent Ridgeans and Parents/Guardians of the 2024 Graduating Cohort,

The GCE O-Level Examination results will be released on Friday, 10 January 2025. Students are required to collect their hardcopy results slip and/or certificate from the school hall, starting at 2.30 pm.

Students must arrive by 2.15 pm, wear full school uniform, and adhere to school rules on grooming and attire. Please note that students who are not properly attired will not be permitted to enter the school hall and will need to collect their results at a later time.

If a student is unable to collect their results personally, they may authorize an adult, 21 years old and above as a proxy to collect on their behalf. Proxies can collect the results from the General Office after 3.45 pm on the day of release. They must provide photo ID for identification and a Letter of Authorisation. To arrange for a proxy, please inform the school through the form teachers or via email at [krss@moe.edu.sg](mailto:krss@moe.edu.sg) .

We regret that car park facilities will not be available for parents/guardians accompanying students. Please use public car parks in the vicinity. Additionally, seating for accompanying parents is limited.

We wish all our Kent Ridgeans the very best for their O-Level results!

Kent Ridge Secondary School
