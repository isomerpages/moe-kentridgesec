### GCE N-Level Examination result
Dear Kent Ridgeans and Parent(s)/Guardians of the 2024 Graduating Cohort,

The GCE N-Level Examination results will be released on Monday, 16 Dec 2024. We will be releasing the results to students in the school hall from 2.00 pm. Students must return to school to collect their hardcopy results slip and/or certificate.  

Students are to report in full school uniform and be seated in the school library (Hall) by 1.45 pm.  School rules and regulations on grooming and attire apply.  Students who are not properly attired will not be able to enter the school and need to wait to collect their results at a later time.

Students who are unable to collect your results personally may appoint a proxy to collect on your behalf. Proxies can collect the results from the General Office after 3.30 pm on the day of the result release. Proxies are required to produce the relevant documents (Photo ID for identification & Letter of Authorisation) for the school’s verification when collecting the results. Please inform the school through the form teachers, e.g. [krss@moe.edu.sg](mailto:krss@moe.edu.sg).

Car park facility will not be available for parents/guardians accompanying your child/ward. Please use the public carparks in the vicinity.  We also seek your understanding that seats for accompanying parents are limited.   

All the best for our Kent Ridgean’s N-Level results!
