**Parent Volunteers**
<br>
The PSG relies on the team of Parent Volunteers (PV) to help organise and participate in many of our activities. Coming from various backgrounds, the skills and resources available from our PVs help in many ways, from sourcing for items required to run events to simply volunteering time and effort to participate in activities. Registered PVs are regularly updated on current and upcoming activities in the school. As a KRSS family, we also support each other by sharing information and advice.

Some frequently asked questions (FAQ):

Q1: Do I have to commit a certain amount of time to be a PV, as I am working full-time?  
A1: No. We will inform PVs of any upcoming activities in advance so that you may plan your time and let us know if you are able to join us in the activity.

Q2: Why does the registration form ask for my occupation (optional)?  
A2: This helps us to understand where you may perhaps be able to further assist the PSG based on your expertise, such as during Careers’ Talk or sourcing for items, just to name a few.

Q3: Does joining the PSG as a PV mean that I will have better access to the school’s staff and leadership team?  
A3: Perhaps it is more likely that you will have better access to resources from your peers, some of whom may have more experience as a parent/guardian in the school having had children enrolled before. As a PSG family, we can help to guide you to the appropriate channel to help address some of your queries or concerns related to the school matters.
