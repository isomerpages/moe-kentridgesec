Good family relationships do not just happen. They require time and effort. The Family Matters! programme helps empower and equip parents to build strong family ties. Through enriching workshops, activities and resources, parents can learn how to build healthy communication with their children and nurture positive relationships within the family. Family Matters! also allows parents to interact with the teachers and other parents in the school to share tips and get advice on family and parenting issues.

Talks that the school have organised this year include ‘Helping Your Child Cope with Exam Stress’, ‘Raising Motivated Teens’, ‘Building Self Esteem and Confidence in Your Teenager’.
