<p><strong>Full Subject-Based Banding</strong> 
<br>Kent Ridge Secondary School has implemented Full Subject-Based Banding
(Full SBB) since 2023.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose of Full SBB</strong> 
<br>Full SBB is part of MOE’s ongoing efforts to nurture the joy of learning
and develop multiple pathways to cater to the different strengths and interests
of our students.</p>
<p>From 2024, secondary schools will have implemented the following aspects
of Full SBB:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Mixed form classes with the provision of a common curriculum; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Offering of Humanities subjects at a more demanding level from Secondary
2.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Secondary 1 students will be grouped in mixed form classes, comprising
students from different posting groups. Mixed form classes present more
opportunities for students to interact with other students taking different
subject combinations, and with different strengths and interests.
<br>
<br>In their mixed form classes, students will take a set of subjects at a
common level, amounting to about one-third of curriculum time. This would
allow students in mixed form classes to spend curriculum time together
in these subjects.
<br>
<br>These subjects are:
<br>- Art
<br>- Character and Citizenship Education
<br>- Design and Technology
<br>- Food and Consumer Education
<br>- Music
<br>- Physical Education
<br>
<br>Teachers will adopt a range of teaching approaches to meet the different
learning needs and pace of their students in the same form class.
<br>
<br>English Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics, and Science will
continue to be offered at G3, G2 and G1 Level. The criteria for taking
these subjects at a more demanding level from the start of Secondary One
is based on students’ PSLE AL Score for each subject. Students will be
grouped in different classes based on their subject level for each subject.</p>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Currently, secondary school students can offer <strong>English Language, Mother Tongue Languages,</strong>  <strong>Mathematics and Science</strong> at
a more demanding level from the start of Secondary One based on students’
PSLE Achievement Level (AL) for each subject. Beyond the start of Secondary
1, students may also offer these subjects at a more demanding level based
on their performance in secondary school.
<br><strong><br>Our school will also provide Secondary 2 students the opportunity to take Humanities subjects at a more demanding level, if they meet subject-specific criteria.</strong>
<br>
<br>The criteria for taking Humanities at a more demanding level will be based
on students’ aptitude for and interest in these subjects at Secondary 1.
They should also possess positive attitude towards learning and strong
commitment to offer the subject at a more demanding level.</p>
