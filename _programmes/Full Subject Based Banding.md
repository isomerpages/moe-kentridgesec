**Full Subject-Based Banding** <br>
Kent Ridge Secondary School has implemented Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB) since 2023.

**Purpose of Full SBB** <br>
Full SBB is part of MOE’s ongoing efforts to nurture the joy of learning and develop multiple pathways to cater to the different strengths and interests of our students.

From 2024, secondary schools will have implemented the following aspects of Full SBB:

*   Mixed form classes with the provision of a common curriculum; and
*   Offering of Humanities subjects at a more demanding level from Secondary 2.

	 <td>Mixed form classes with the provision of a common curriculum</td>
    <td>Secondary 1 students will be grouped in mixed form classes, comprising students from different posting groups. Mixed form classes present more opportunities for students to interact with other students taking different subject combinations, and with different strengths and interests.<br><br>
In their mixed form classes, students will take a set of subjects at a common level, amounting to about one-third of curriculum time. This would allow students in mixed form classes to spend curriculum time together in these subjects.<br>
<br>These subjects are:<br>- Art<br>- Character and Citizenship Education<br>- Design and Technology<br>- Food and Consumer Education<br>- Music<br>- Physical Education<br><br>
Teachers will adopt a range of teaching approaches to meet the different learning needs and pace of their students in the same form class.<br><br>English Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics, and Science will continue to be offered at G3, G2 and G1 Level. The criteria for taking these subjects at a more demanding level from the start of Secondary One is based on students’ PSLE AL Score for each subject. Students will be grouped in different classes based on their subject level for each subject.</td>

They should also possess positive attitude towards learning and strong commitment to offer the subject at a more demanding level.</td>
