**Full Subject-Based Banding** <br>
Kent Ridge Secondary School is one of 30+ secondary schools which will implement Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB) from 2023.

*   Offering of Humanities subjects at a more demanding level from Secondary 2.

This would allow students in mixed form classes to spend curriculum time together in these subjects.<br>These subjects are:<br>Art<br>Character and Citizenship Education<br>Design and Technology<br>Food and Consumer Education<br>Music<br>Physical Education<br>Teachers will adopt a range of teaching approaches to meet the different learning needs and pace of their students in the same form class.<br>English Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics, and Science will continue to be offered at Express Level, N(A) Level, and N(T) Level. The criteria for taking these subjects at a more demanding level from the start of Secondary One is based on students’ PSLE AL Score for each subject. Students will be grouped in different classes based on their subject level for each subject.</td>
