<p>The Kent Ridge Secondary School Concert Band, established in 2001, has been around since the school’s inception in the year 2000. Kent Ridge Concert Band is the crucible in which capable leaders and strong friendships are forged. The Band is a contributing factor in the school’s artistic atmosphere with its wide collection of genres that ranges from classical compositions to pop, jazz, rock and even traditional folk songs. The Concert Band participates in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) biannually and on alternate years, we participate in the school’s very own concert, Vivace! It is an avenue for visual performing art CCAs to showcase their talents in front of an audience while raising funds for charity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This year, the Band participated in the Singapore Youth Festival despite the strict Safe Management Measures during the current COVID-19 pandemic, and pulled through countless hours of online practice sessions, overcoming many limitations and restrictions. Concert Band displayed resilience and perseverance during these trying times, achieving a certificate of Accomplishment for SYF.</p>

Our programme’s objectives are to create a conducive, safe and collaborative environment for students to appreciate and explore a variety of dance genres consisting mainly of contemporary and jazz along with hip-hop, ballroom and ballet. To develop their confidence and stage presence, students are exposed to school platforms like CCA Fair, Awards Day and Teachers’ Day, as well as external platforms like the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation, Danceworks!, TRDO and West Coast CC National Day Celebration. Behind the scenes, the dancers build their skills through holiday workshops and inter-school exchanges. We welcome you to the Modern Dance Club, a family that braves challenges together and where everyone is allowed to grow at their own pace.</p>

<p>KRSS Drama Club is a vibrant CCA which fosters a strong bond between the members who work together as a team within individual strengths. The school currently engages inwardBOUND - Transformation Through Drama which have been partners of Kent Ridge Secondary since 2023. The club explores different theatrical plays and seeks to not only entertain but also educate our audiences through our dramatic pieces, ranging from modern to traditional. The Kent Ridge Drama Club participates in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation (SYF AP) once every two years, where we recently attained a Certificate of Distinction in 2023. The piece entitled ‘Sejarah Melayu’ talks about a group of students on an excursion to an old Singapore village exhibition. As they discuss the exhibit, they grow more interested in the story that comes alive in front of their very eyes. By the end, they understand a little more about the myths and legends that locals have lived with for hundreds of years but are rarely discussed in modern times. They start to question how many stories have been lost to time, and why other stories have persisted. <br><br>
On alternate years, the club participate in various performances in school, as well as other external performances. Not only that, Kent Ridge Drama Club seeks to explore learning through watching professional plays outside of school. Through opportunities such as LLP and re:ACT Festival, the club explores collaboration pieces with other CCAs, schools or organisations locally. The Drama Club fills the lively atmosphere of the school in school performances like CCA Fair, Awards Day cum National Day Celebration, Open House and many others. Our members not only learn to be artistically inclined but they cherish the bonds of friendships built during their stay with us.</p>
