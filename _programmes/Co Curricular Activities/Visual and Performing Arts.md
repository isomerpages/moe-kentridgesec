<p>The Kent Ridge Choir – “Kent Ridge Voices” – was formed when the school
started in January 2000. Under the guidance of our conductor, Ms Ong Chiak
Yin, it aims to be a dynamic group as it strives for choral excellence.
To achieve this, the choir has undergone intensive training of music theory
and voice enrichment under voice specialists. The Kent Ridge Voices takes
part in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation and the school's
biennial Vivace! concert. Over the years, the Kent Ridge Voices has also
performed for the Voices of Singapore Festival.

<p>The Kent Ridge Secondary School Concert Band, established in 2001, has
been around since the school’s inception in the year 2000. Kent Ridge Concert
Band is the crucible in which capable leaders and strong friendships are
forged. The Band is a contributing factor in the school’s artistic atmosphere
with its wide collection of genres that ranges from classical compositions
to pop, jazz, rock and even traditional folk songs. The Concert Band participates
in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) biannually and on alternate years,
we participate in the school’s very own concert, Vivace! It is an avenue
for visual performing art CCAs to showcase their talents in front of an
audience while raising funds for charity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This year, the Band participated in the Singapore Youth Festival despite
the strict Safe Management Measures during the current COVID-19 pandemic,
and pulled through countless hours of online practice sessions, overcoming
many limitations and restrictions. Concert Band displayed resilience and
perseverance during these trying times, achieving a certificate of Accomplishment
for SYF.

<p>KRSS Drama Club is a vibrant CCA which fosters a strong bond between the
members who work together as a team within individual strengths. The school
currently engages inwardBOUND - Transformation Through Drama which have
been partners of Kent Ridge Secondary since 2023. The club explores different
theatrical plays and seeks to not only entertain but also educate our audiences
through our dramatic pieces, ranging from modern to traditional. The Kent
Ridge Drama Club participates in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation
(SYF AP) once every two years, where we recently attained a Certificate
of Distinction in 2023. The piece entitled ‘Sejarah Melayu’ talks about
a group of students on an excursion to an old Singapore village exhibition.
As they discuss the exhibit, they grow more interested in the story that
comes alive in front of their very eyes. By the end, they understand a
little more about the myths and legends that locals have lived with for
hundreds of years but are rarely discussed in modern times. They start
to question how many stories have been lost to time, and why other stories
have persisted.
<br>
<br>On alternate years, the club participate in various performances in school,
as well as other external performances. Not only that, Kent Ridge Drama
Club seeks to explore learning through watching professional plays outside
of school. Through opportunities such as LLP and re:ACT Festival, the club
explores collaboration pieces with other CCAs, schools or organisations
locally. The Drama Club fills the lively atmosphere of the school in school
performances like CCA Fair, Awards Day cum National Day Celebration, Open
House and many others. Our members not only learn to be artistically inclined
but they cherish the bonds of friendships built during their stay with
us.
