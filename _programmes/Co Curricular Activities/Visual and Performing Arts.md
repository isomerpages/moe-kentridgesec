<p>The Kent Ridge Choir – “Kent Ridge Voices” – was formed when the school
started in January 2000. Under the guidance of our conductor, Ms Ong Chiak
Yin, it aims to be a dynamic group as it strives for choral excellence.
To achieve this, the choir has undergone intensive training of music theory
and voice enrichment under voice specialists. The Kent Ridge Voices takes
part in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation and the school's
biennial Vivace! concert. Over the years, the Kent Ridge Voices has also
performed for the Voices of Singapore Festival.

<p>The Kent Ridge Modern Dance Club prides itself on having a dedicated and
enthusiastic team of students, teachers and instructors. Our programme’s
objectives are to create a conducive, safe and collaborative environment
for students to appreciate and explore a variety of dance genres consisting
mainly of contemporary and jazz along with hip-hop, ballroom and ballet.
To develop their confidence and stage presence, students are exposed to
school platforms like CCA Fair, Chinese New Year and Hari Raya concerts,
as well as external platforms like the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation,
West Coast CC National Day Celebration and the SSSC Colours Award Presentation
and National School Games Closing Ceremony. Behind the scenes, the dancers
build their skills through holiday workshops and inter-school exchanges.
We welcome you to the Modern Dance Club, a family that braves challenges
together and where everyone is allowed to grow at their own pace.

<p>KRSS Drama Club is a vibrant CCA that fosters a strong bond between the
members who work together as a team with individual strengths. The school
currently engages inwardBOUND - Transformation Through Drama, which has
been a partner of Kent Ridge Secondary since 2023. The club explores different
theatrical plays and seeks to not only entertain but also educate our audiences
through our dramatic pieces, ranging from modern to traditional. The Kent
Ridge Drama Club participates in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation
(SYF AP) once every two years, where we recently attained a Certificate
of Accomplishment in 2025. The piece entitled ‘Those Were The Days’ follows
Grandpa Tony, an old man with memory issues, and his granddaughter. Tony
recounts to his granddaughter some significant moments in his life, from
his teenage crushes to his interesting friendships, and takes her on a
trip down memory lane.</p>
<p></p>
<p>On alternate years, the club participates in various performances in school,
as well as other external performances. Not only that, Kent Ridge Drama
Club seeks to explore learning through watching professional plays outside
of school. Through opportunities such as LLP and CCA VIA, termed re:ACT
Festival, the club explores collaboration pieces with other CCAs, schools,
or organisations locally. The Drama Club fills the lively atmosphere of
the school with school performances like CCA Fair, Total Defence Day, festive
celebrations such as Chinese New Year and Hari Raya Concerts, Awards Day
cum National Day Celebration, Open House, and many others. Our members
not only learn to be artistically inclined, but they also cherish the bonds
of friendships built during their stay with us.
