<p>Established in 2016, eARTh Club continues to march on in our mission to raise awareness to promote respect and care for our environment with the infusion of Art elements. Our members serve as advocates for the environment and gain opportunities to get in touch with nature through learning journeys to locations such as Siloso Beach Resort, Gardens by the Bay and Tuas Incineration Plant. Our club also works closely with external partners such as NEA, Southwest CDC and MINDS Lee Kong Chian Gardens School in coming up with exciting programmes and activities for our members. Our members also get to hone their creativity and artistic talents in designing educational posters to raise awareness on contemporary environmental issues. Our club aspires to continue to be the change we want to see in this world!</p>

<p>The Kent Ridge Secondary School Concert Band, established in 2001, has been around since the school’s inception in the year 2000. Kent Ridge Concert Band is the crucible in which capable leaders and strong friendships are forged. The Band is a contributing factor in the school’s artistic atmosphere with its wide collection of genres that ranges from classical compositions to pop, jazz, rock and even traditional folk songs. The Concert Band participates in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) biannually and on alternate years, we participate in the school’s very own concert, Vivace! It is an avenue for visual performing art CCAs to showcase their talents in front of an audience while raising funds for charity. </p>
<p>This year, the Band participated in the Singapore Youth Festival despite the strict Safe Management Measures during the current COVID-19 pandemic, and pulled through countless hours of online practice sessions, overcoming many limitations and restrictions. Concert Band displayed resilience and perseverance during these trying times, achieving a certificate of Accomplishment for SYF.</p>

Our programme’s objectives are to create a conducive, safe and collaborative environment for students to appreciate and explore a variety of dance genres consisting mainly of contemporary and jazz along with hip-hop, ballroom and ballet. To develop their confidence and stage presence, students are exposed to school platforms like CCA Fair, Awards Day and Teachers’ Day, as well as external platforms like the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation, Danceworks!, TRDO and West Coast CC National Day Celebration. Behind the scenes, the dancers build their skills through holiday workshops and inter-school exchanges.

<p>At Kent Ridge, the Drama Club is a vibrant CCA and currently stands at 34-strong. Kent Ridge Drama Club fosters a strong bond between the members who work together as a team within individual strengths. The school currently engages Toy Factory Productions Ltd which have been partners of Kent Ridge Secondary since 2020. The club explores different theatrical plays and seeks to not only entertain but also educate our audiences through our dramatic pieces, ranging from modern to tradiitonal. The Kent Ridge Drama Club participates in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation (SYF AP) once every two years, where we recently attained a Certificate of Commendation in 2019. The piece entitled ‘Intertwined’ explores the theme of modern slavery in a family, where different circumstances were explored with each character in the family. On alternate years, we participate in our school’s very own concert, Vivace! as well as other external performances. Not only that, Kent Ridge Drama Club seeks to explore learning through watching professional plays outside of school. Whenever we have the opportunity, we explore collaboration pieces with other schools or organisations locally. The Drama Club fills the lively atmosphere of the school in school performances like CCA Fair, Awards Day cum National Day Celebration and other performances. Our members not only learn to be artistically inclined but they cherish the bonds of friendships built during their stay with us. Be a member of the Drama Club and we hope to see you soon!</p>
