<p>Kent Ridge Secondary School Badminton Team&#39;s curriculum is designed to give a consistent and systematic training structure to develop the talents of our students as well as to nurture their talents and potential to the fullest. This will encourage our students to develop a lifelong interest and passion that will sustain a healthy lifestyle. Apart from building up the physical fitness, mental fortitude and game skills of our students, the badminton training sessions and co-curricular activities, undergirded by the school values, are also good platforms for our students to develop positive character traits which will strengthen their 21st Century Competency skills and translate them into positive attitudes and self-expressions. Our boys and girls take part in sanctioned competitions and achieve credible results and rankings.</p>
