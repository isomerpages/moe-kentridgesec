<p>Kent Ridge Secondary School Badminton Team&#39;s curriculum is designed to give a consistent and systematic training structure to develop the talents of our students as well as to nurture their talents and potential to the fullest. This will encourage our students to develop a lifelong interest and passion that will sustain a healthy lifestyle. Apart from building up the physical fitness, mental fortitude and game skills of our students, the badminton training sessions and co-curricular activities, undergirded by the school values, are also good platforms for our students to develop positive character traits which will strengthen their 21st Century Competency skills and translate them into positive attitudes and self-expressions. Our boys and girls take part in sanctioned competitions and achieve credible results and rankings.</p>

<p>Our motto of “One Voice, One Team, One Goal!” spells out the motivational force of our Basketball Team. We have &#39;B&#39; and &#39;C&#39; Divisions Boys and Girls teams, with a healthy recruitment of members from each gender yearly. The Indoor Sports Hall Level 1 is home to our training; aspiring to provide our students with a platform for acquiring new skills, techniques and strategies in basketball as we believe in a structured training programme to harness the potentials of our players. Our teams focus on both offensive and defensive basketball strategies where every player is responsible in improving their personal mastery while staying grounded with our school values of resilience and sportsmanship. We strongly believe in harnessing student leadership and will create suitable leadership positions such as Captain, Vice-Captains, Student Well-Being Representatives, Training, VIA, Logistics and Administration Personnel to develop our students to be well-rounded future leaders. Training sessions take place at the school’s Indoor Sports Hall Level 1.</p>
