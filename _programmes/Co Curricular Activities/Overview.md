<p>As part of character development, CCA is a key student development experience.
CCA is a core component of our holistic curriculum where students discover
their interests and talents, while learning important life skills. At the
secondary level, CCA is compulsory; each student will participate in at
least one school-based CCA.</p>
<p>Kent Ridge offers 19 CCAs and each CCA offers engaging programmes to build
students’ character and develop their leadership competencies.</p>

<p><strong>LEAPS 2.0 Framework</strong>
<br>Our CCA programmes are guided by the LEAPS 2.0 framework to encourage
and recognise students’ holistic development in life skills, competencies
and values.&nbsp; Students will be recognised with levels of attainment
in Participation, Achievement, Leadership and Service domains.&nbsp; More
information can be found at this link: <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.moe.gov.sg/education-in-sg/our-programmes/cca/leaps2-0</a>
</p>
<p>At the end of the graduating year, students’ CCA attainment can be used
for admission to Junior Colleges/Polytechnics/Institute of Technical Education
(JC/Poly/ITE).&nbsp;</p>
