<p>As part of character development, CCA is a key student development experience.  CCA is a core component of our holistic curriculum where students discover their interests and talents, while learning important life skills.  At the secondary level, CCA is compulsory; each student will participate in at least one school-based CCA. </p><p>Kent Ridge offers 18 CCAs and each CCA offers engaging programmes to build students’ character and develop their leadership competencies. </p><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>CCA Groups</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>CCAs</strong></p></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Clubs and Societies</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Debate Society, International Chess, InfoComm Club, Media Club</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Physical Sports</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Badminton, Basketball, Floorball, Football, Outdoor Adventure Club</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Uniformed Groups</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Boys’ Brigade, Girls’ Brigade, National Cadet Corp, National Police Cadet Corp</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Visual and Performing Arts</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Choir, Concert Band, Dance, Drama, eARTh Club</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><u>LEAPS 2.0 Framework</u><br>Our CCA programmes are guided by the LEAPS 2.0 framework to encourage and recognise students’ holistic development in life skills, competencies and values.&nbsp; Students will be recognised with levels of attainment in Participation, Achievement, Leadership and Service domains.&nbsp; More information can be found at this link: <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.moe.gov.sg/education-in-sg/our-programmes/cca/leaps2-0</a></p><p>At the end of the graduating year, students’ CCA attainment can be used for admission to Junior Colleges/Polytechnics/Institute of Technical Education (JC/Poly/ITE).&nbsp;</p><p></p>
