<p>The Kent Ridge Secondary School Concert Band, established in 2001, has been around since the school’s inception in the year 2000. Kent Ridge Concert Band is the crucible in which capable leaders and strong friendships are forged. The Band is a contributing factor in the school’s artistic atmosphere with its wide collection of genres that ranges from classical compositions to pop, jazz, rock and even traditional folk songs. The Concert Band participates in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) biannually and on alternate years, we participate in the school’s very own concert, Vivace! It is an avenue for visual performing art CCAs to showcase their talents in front of an audience while raising funds for charity. </p>
<p>This year, the Band participated in the Singapore Youth Festival despite the strict Safe Management Measures during the current COVID-19 pandemic, and pulled through countless hours of online practice sessions, overcoming many limitations and restrictions. Concert Band displayed resilience and perseverance during these trying times, achieving a certificate of Accomplishment for SYF.</p>
