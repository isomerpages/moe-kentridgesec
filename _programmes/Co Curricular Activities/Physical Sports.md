<p>KRSS Floorball Team was established in 2008 with a pioneer cohort of 36
enthusiastic Kent Ridgeans. Growing in strength over the last 12 years,
the CCA now comprises of more than 100 dedicated players. Floorball was
introduced to students as a team sport to allow learning beyond the classroom.
Besides developing physical fitness, our CCA programme aims to help students
develop personal qualities such as teamwork, discipline and leadership
skills. Floorball is an indoor sport and is usually played with 16 players
in a competition team. It is fast gaining popularity in our school and
Singapore as it is easy to pick up and fun to play. Skills trainings are
conducted in indoor venues with fibreglass panel boards to build up our
skills and game strategies. To give our players greater exposure, friendly
matches are arranged to let them gain experience and increase their confidence
level during competitions.</p>
