<p>The Debate Society, formerly a special interest group, is a newly-established CCA in 2017. The CCA aims to develop student-debaters who are able to think critically and speak skilfully. We train our students in the art of debating, focusing on the domains of research, speech, and working together in a team. We take part in debate competitions such as the Singapore Secondary Schools Debating Championships, Youth Debate Open and Raffles Debate Academy Under-14 Debating Championship. Every year, the students embark on VIA projects to pass on their debating skills and knowledge to the community by organising public speaking workshops or mentoring sessions for other youths or children from various organisations. In this CCA, the debaters are not only trained to be quick-witted and articulate speakers, but the many opportunities to work in teams also teach them the value of camaraderie and friendship.</p>

<p>In line with the School’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in “<strong>Computational Thinking through Robotics</strong>”, Infocomm Club aims to further develop the skills and competencies of students with greater interest and aptitude in computational thinking and robotics. The 4 – 5 years development programme allows students to deepen their computational thinking and robotics skills and knowledge, and to apply what they have learnt to design, code and build robotic solutions of increasing complexity to complete challenging missions and to address real world needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The training framework for Infocomm Club students details a clear progression of skills from introduction to computational thinking, programming and robotics in Sec 1, to deepening of programming and robotics skills in Sec 2 and 3, to maker skills in Sec 4 and 5. From 2022 onwards, students would also be introduced to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and learn to build simple AI applications, and subsequently create AI solutions through an AI project cycle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students participate in different competitions to hone their skills and are selected based on their learning progress. Through the process of training for the competitions, students learn to apply their skills in new ways, leverage on team members’ strengths to complete complex missions and be resilient in the face of challenges to continue to invent better solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students also apply their skills to help others during community projects e.g. prior to the pandemic, Sec 1s introduced robotics to pre-schoolers from a PCF kindergarten by guiding them through different games based on Scratch and mBots that are designed by themselves. Sec 2s and 3s supported the NYAA Gold Award Holders’ Alumni’s effort to raise awareness among the residents at Clementi West, West Coast GRC on e-waste recycling. Students were also invited to participate in a collaboration with ACS (I), where students from ACS (I) shared their expertise in Vex Robotics.</p>

<p>International Chess is a newly established CCA in 2023. It was formerly a special interest group and had about 30 students playing regularly and taking part in school competitions.&nbsp; The objectives of International Chess are to build character, team spirit and responsibility. Playing chess helps students in developing problem-solving skills, critical thinking and creativity. It also helps improve students’ memory and concentration. We will train students to take part in internal and external chess competitions.</p>

<p>The Media Club, formerly known as the AVA Club, began in 2000 with only six pioneer members under the Media Resource Library. 2002 was a milestone for the club as it celebrated its recognition as an official CCA. As a service-oriented CCA, with a strength of 80 members to date, Media Club has thrived through the sheer dedication of its teachers and members in all school events pertaining to Audio Visual (AV) support, live telecasting, video shooting, digital photography, production of videos and photo slideshows. Students build their expertise by undergoing training in workshops and engaging with multiple hands-on projects to develop artefacts that can be used in their portfolios. They are also supported with a wide range of equipment from studio lighting to DSLR cameras. In addition, members are exposed to a plethora of talks, exhibitions and competitions to express their creativity and skills as well as to showcase their works.</p>
