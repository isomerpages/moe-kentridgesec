<p>The Debate Society, formerly a special interest group, is a newly-established CCA in 2017. The CCA aims to develop student-debaters who are able to think critically and speak skilfully. We train our students in the art of debating, focusing on the domains of research, speech, and working together in a team. We take part in debate competitions such as the Singapore Secondary Schools Debating Championships, Youth Debate Open and Raffles Debate Academy Under-14 Debating Championship. Every year, the students embark on VIA projects to pass on their debating skills and knowledge to the community by organising public speaking workshops or mentoring sessions for other youths or children from various organisations. In this CCA, the debaters are not only trained to be quick-witted and articulate speakers, but the many opportunities to work in teams also teach them the value of camaraderie and friendship.</p>

<p>Established in 2016, eARTh Club continues to march on in our mission to raise awareness to promote respect and care for our environment with the infusion of Art elements. Our members serve as advocates for the environment and gain opportunities to get in touch with nature through learning journeys to locations such as Siloso Beach Resort, Gardens by the Bay and Tuas Incineration Plant. Our club also works closely with external partners such as NEA, Southwest CDC and MINDS Lee Kong Chian Gardens School in coming up with exciting programmes and activities for our members. Our members also get to hone their creativity and artistic talents in designing educational posters to raise awareness on contemporary environmental issues. Our club aspires to continue to be the change we want to see in this world!</p>

      <p><strong>Day / Time:</strong><br>MONDAY: 1515 - 1815 HRS<br>THURSDAY: 1515 - 1815 HRS</p>
<p>In line with the School’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in “<strong>Computational Thinking through Robotics</strong>”, Infocomm Club aims to further develop the skills and competencies of students with greater interest and aptitude in computational thinking and robotics. The 4 – 5 years development programme allows students to deepen their computational thinking and robotics skills and knowledge, and to apply what they have learnt to design, code and build robotic solutions of increasing complexity to complete challenging missions and to address real world needs. </p>
<p>The training framework for Infocomm Club students details a clear progression of skills from introduction to computational thinking, programming and robotics in Sec 1, to deepening of programming and robotics skills in Sec 2 and 3, to maker skills in Sec 4 and 5. From 2022 onwards, students would also be introduced to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and learn to build simple AI applications, and subsequently create AI solutions through an AI project cycle. </p>
<p>Students participate in different competitions to hone their skills and are selected based on their learning progress. Through the process of training for the competitions, students learn to apply their skills in new ways, leverage on team members’ strengths to complete complex missions and be resilient in the face of challenges to continue to invent better solutions. </p>
<p>Students also apply their skills to help others during community projects e.g. prior to the pandemic, Sec 1s introduced robotics to pre-schoolers from a PCF kindergarten by guiding them through different games based on Scratch and mBots that are designed by themselves. Sec 2s and 3s supported the NYAA Gold Award Holders’ Alumni’s effort to raise awareness among the residents at Clementi West, West Coast GRC on e-waste recycling. Students were also invited to participate in a collaboration with ACS (I), where students from ACS (I) shared their expertise in Vex Robotics.</p>
