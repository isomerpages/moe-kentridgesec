<p>The Debate Society, formerly a special interest group, is a newly-established
CCA in 2017. The CCA aims to develop student-debaters who are able to think
critically and speak skilfully. We train our students in the art of debating,
focusing on the domains of research, speech, and working together in a
team. We take part in debate competitions such as the Singapore Secondary
Schools Debating Championships, Youth Debate Open and Raffles Debate Academy
Under-14 Debating Championship. Every year, the students embark on VIA
projects to pass on their debating skills and knowledge to the community
by organising public speaking workshops or mentoring sessions for other
youths or children from various organisations. In this CCA, the debaters
are not only trained to be quick-witted and articulate speakers, but the
many opportunities to work in teams also teach them the value of camaraderie
and friendship.</p>

<p><strong>Day / Time:</strong>
<br>MONDAY: 1535 - 1800 HRS
<br>THURSDAY: 1535- 1800 HRS</p>
<p><strong>Mission:</strong>Infocomm members are equipped through collaboration,
community engagement and skill development to be computational thinkers
and work independently and as a group.</p>
<p>Infocomm Club aims to further develop the skills and competencies of students
with greater interest and aptitude in computational thinking and robotics.
The 4 – 5 years development programme allows students to deepen their computational
thinking and robotics skills and knowledge, and to apply what they have
learnt to design, code and build robotic solutions of increasing complexity
to complete challenging missions and to address real world needs.
<br>
<br>The training framework for Infocomm Club students details a clear progression
of skills from introduction to computational thinking, programming and
robotics in Sec 1, to deepening of programming and robotics skills in Sec
2 and 3, to coding and app development skills in Sec 4 and 5.
<br>
<br>Students participate in different competitions to hone their skills and
are selected based on their learning progress. Through the process of training
for the competitions, students learn to apply their skills in new ways,
leverage on team members’ strengths to complete complex missions and be
resilient in the face of challenges to continue to invent better solutions.
<br>
<br>Students also apply their skills to help others during community projects
this will be led by the Secondary 3 and 4 seniors. Secondary 3 and 4 students
will also take on the responsibility of developing their leadership skills
through training and mentoring their juniors.</p>

<p>International Chess is a newly established CCA in 2023. It was formerly
a special interest group and had about 30 students playing regularly and
taking part in school competitions.&nbsp; The objectives of International
Chess are to build character, team spirit and responsibility. Playing chess
helps students in developing problem-solving skills, critical thinking
and creativity. It also helps improve students’ memory and concentration.
We will train students to take part in internal and external chess competitions.</p>

six pioneer members under the Media Resource Library. 2002 was a milestone
for the club as it celebrated its recognition as an official CCA. As a
service-oriented CCA, with a strength of 80 members to date, Media Club
has thrived through the sheer dedication of its teachers and members in
all school events pertaining to Audio Visual (AV) support, live telecasting,
video shooting, digital photography, production of videos and photo slideshows.
Students build their expertise by undergoing training in workshops and
engaging with multiple hands-on projects to develop artefacts that can
be used in their portfolios. They are also supported with a wide range
of equipment from studio lighting to DSLR cameras. In addition, members
are exposed to a plethora of talks, exhibitions and competitions to express
their creativity and skills as well as to showcase their works.</p>
