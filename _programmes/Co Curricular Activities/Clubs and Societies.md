<p>The Debate Society, formerly a special interest group, is a newly-established CCA in 2017. The CCA aims to develop student-debaters who are able to think critically and speak skilfully. We train our students in the art of debating, focusing on the domains of research, speech, and working together in a team. We take part in debate competitions such as the Singapore Secondary Schools Debating Championships, Youth Debate Open and Raffles Debate Academy Under-14 Debating Championship. Every year, the students embark on VIA projects to pass on their debating skills and knowledge to the community by organising public speaking workshops or mentoring sessions for other youths or children from various organisations. In this CCA, the debaters are not only trained to be quick-witted and articulate speakers, but the many opportunities to work in teams also teach them the value of camaraderie and friendship.</p>
