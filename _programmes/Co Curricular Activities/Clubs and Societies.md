<p>The Debate Society, formerly a special interest group, is a newly-established CCA in 2017. The CCA aims to develop student-debaters who are able to think critically and speak skilfully. We train our students in the art of debating, focusing on the domains of research, speech, and working together in a team. We take part in debate competitions such as the Singapore Secondary Schools Debating Championships, Youth Debate Open and Raffles Debate Academy Under-14 Debating Championship. Every year, the students embark on VIA projects to pass on their debating skills and knowledge to the community by organising public speaking workshops or mentoring sessions for other youths or children from various organisations. In this CCA, the debaters are not only trained to be quick-witted and articulate speakers, but the many opportunities to work in teams also teach them the value of camaraderie and friendship.</p>

<p>Established in 2016, eARTh Club continues to march on in our mission to raise awareness to promote respect and care for our environment with the infusion of Art elements. Our members serve as advocates for the environment and gain opportunities to get in touch with nature through learning journeys to locations such as Siloso Beach Resort, Gardens by the Bay and Tuas Incineration Plant. Our club also works closely with external partners such as NEA, Southwest CDC and MINDS Lee Kong Chian Gardens School in coming up with exciting programmes and activities for our members. Our members also get to hone their creativity and artistic talents in designing educational posters to raise awareness on contemporary environmental issues. Our club aspires to continue to be the change we want to see in this world!</p>
