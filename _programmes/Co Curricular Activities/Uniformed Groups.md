<p>The 74th Boys' Brigade Company started in 2000 with seven boys and now
stands at about 35 members strong. Our programme is run with the help of
Volunteer Adult Officers. We have a wide range of activities such as character
and leadership development, drills, Lifeskills, first aid, kayaking, rock
wall climbing, archery, cycling and yearly camps that help our boys learn
values to develop a character of Obedience, Discipline, Self-Respect, Integrity
and Humility. They can attain the rank of Staff Sergeant by Sec 4 or Sec
5 in their leadership journey, with numerous leadership opportunities for
the Boys. The Boys form a close sense of camaraderie and a bond of brotherhood
during their time in the company. We aim to be the Uniformed Group of choice
in Kent Ridge Secondary School. Over the years, the Boys have grown in
maturity and character and two of them were recently the valedictorians
of the Secondary 4N and 5N streams in 2020.

<p>The Girls’ Brigade's mission is to develop each girl and officer to her
fullest potential by equipping, empowering and enabling every girl to be
a leader, and every officer to be a servant leader. This is done through
the GB programme, which is meant to develop the girls' character, social-emotional
and leadership competencies. They will learn good values, be equipped with
leadership skills, and be given the opportunities to lead and serve at
home, in the company, and in their local community through planning and
executing activities such as camps and VIA activities. They can attain
the rank of Master Staff Sergeant by Sec 4 or Sec 5 in their leadership
journey, with leadership equipping and opportunities that are structured
into the yearly programme, spiralling up from Sec 1. There is an annual
competition, that alternates between the National Drill Competition and
the Low Guat Tin Challenge, that the girls can aspire to participate in.
Through passion and hardwork, the 54th Company has achieved good results
thus far. Over the years, the 54th Company of the Girls' Brigade in Kent
Ridge Secondary has grown steadily in strength with the faithful support
of the Volunteer Adult Officers. Come and join us in this GB 54th family!

<p>The Kent Ridge Secondary School's National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) develops
our students to be active citizens and community leaders, by working in
partnership with the Singapore Police Force to fight crime and keep Singapore
safe. NPCC aims to become the best youth organisation in Singapore, one
that actively helps to make Singapore the safest place in the world. Our
programmes and activities are designed to develop leaders with good character
and values, to build bonds with the Singpaore Police Force, and to show
care and concern to those who are in need. We want our cadets to be resilient
and to be able to face challenges and turn them to opportunities while
striving for excellence. NPCC cadets discover themselves by stepping out
and interacting with others in their lower secondary years. The cadets
progress to have experiences of being leaders as they take charge of their
juniors and events, with the ultimate goal of leading the Unit.
