<p>The 74th Boys&#39; Brigade Company started in 2000 with seven boys and now stands at about 35 members strong. Our programme is run with the help of Volunteer Adult Officers. We have a wide range of activities such as character and leadership development, drills, Lifeskills, first aid, kayaking, rock wall climbing, archery, cycling and yearly camps that help our boys learn values to develop a character of Obedience, Discipline, Self-Respect, Integrity and Humility. They can attain the rank of Staff Sergeant by Sec 4 or Sec 5 in their leadership journey, with numerous leadership opportunities for the Boys. The Boys form a close sense of camaraderie and a bond of brotherhood during their time in the company. We aim to be the Uniformed Group of choice in Kent Ridge Secondary School. Over the years, the Boys have grown in maturity and character and two of them were recently the valedictorians of the Secondary 4N and 5N streams in 2020.</p>

<p>The Girls’ Brigade&#39;s mission is to develop each girl and officer to her fullest potential by equipping, empowering and enabling every girl to be a leader, and every officer to be a servant leader. This is done through the GB programme, which is meant to develop the girls&#39; character, social-emotional and leadership competencies. They will learn good values, be equipped with leadership skills, and be given the opportunities to lead and serve at home, in the company, and in their local community through planning and executing activities such as camps and VIA activities. They can attain the rank of Master Staff Sergeant by Sec 4 or Sec 5 in their leadership journey, with leadership equipping and opportunities that are structured into the yearly programme, spiralling up from Sec 1. There is an annual competition, that alternates between the National Drill Competition and the Low Guat Tin Challenge, that the girls can aspire to participate in. Through passion and hardwork, the 54th Company has achieved good results thus far. Over the years, the 54th Company of the Girls&#39; Brigade in Kent Ridge Secondary has grown steadily in strength with the faithful support of the Volunteer Adult Officers. Come and join us in this GB 54th family!</p>
