<p>From 2 to 5 June 2025, 36 students and 5 teachers embarked on a meaningful
4D3N learning journey to <strong>Hanoi, Vietnam</strong>, blending cultural
immersion, eco-stewardship, and ASEAN connectedness. Designed to develop
students’ <strong>21st Century Competencies (e21CC)</strong> — such as <em>Global Awareness, Civic Literacy, Critical and Inventive Thinking</em>,
and <em>Social-Emotional Skills</em> — the trip provided authentic learning
experiences beyond the classroom.</p>
<p>Students explored the <strong>Hoa Binh Hydroelectric Plant</strong>, Vietnam’s
second largest, gaining insights into renewable energy and sustainable
development. At <strong>Duong Lam Ancient Village</strong>, they engaged
in hands-on activities that showcased traditional Vietnamese craftsmanship
and community living, while their visit to the <strong>Vietnam Military History Museum</strong> deepened
understanding of Vietnam’s resilience and independence. These experiences
encouraged students to think critically, make cross-cultural connections,
and appreciate shared regional values within ASEAN.</p>
<p>A key highlight was the visit to <strong>Cau Giay Secondary School</strong>,
where students bonded with their Vietnamese peers through friendly matches
and cultural exchanges. Teachers also conducted a professional sharing
session on <strong>Educational Technology</strong>, demonstrating how the <strong>Student Learning Space (SLS)</strong> fosters
engagement — strengthening collaboration and communication across borders.
Another memorable experience was at <strong>Friendship Village</strong>,
where students interacted with children affected by Agent Orange, nurturing
empathy, compassion, and respect.</p>
<p>The journey reinforced the importance of <strong>integrity</strong> and <strong>national identity</strong>,
as students represented Singapore with pride and responsibility. The <strong>Hanoi Cultural and Learning Journey 2025</strong> truly
embodied the school’s vision — nurturing hearts of compassion, inventive
minds, and resilient spirits ready to thrive in a global community.</p>
