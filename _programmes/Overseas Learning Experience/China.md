</p>
<p>The key highlight was the series of industrial visits to <strong>Tencent</strong>, <strong>DJI</strong>,
and <strong>BGI Genomics</strong>. Students marvelled at the rapid pace
of technological advancement these companies have achieved. For instance,
they learned how genome mapping, once a 13-year process, can now be completed
within days. Through engaging presentations and guided tours, students
gained insights into the core values, culture, and work ethos that drive
these companies toward excellence and innovation. These experiences broadened
their understanding of global industry trends and inspired them to reflect
on their future aspirations and career pathways.</p>

</p>
<p>Throughout the trip, the students gained a profound appreciation for Singapore
and its place in a globalised world. These experiences inspired them to
think about how they could contribute meaningfully to the nation’s continued
progress. The students also strengthened their bonds of friendship on this
trip and this collaborative spirit was reflected in their daily reflections,
where they harnessed individual strengths to create two-minute video reflections
that captured their key learning experiences.</p>
<p>The Shenzhen, China Internationalisation Trip 2025 truly embodied the
school's vision of nurturing hearts of compassion, inventive minds, and
resilient spirits ready to thrive in a global community, living out the
spirit of going <em>Beyond Frontiers</em>.</p>
