where they harnessed individual strengths to create two-minute video reflections
that captured their key learning experiences.</p>

school's vision of nurturing hearts of compassion, inventive minds, and

<p><strong>Student Reflections</strong>
</p>
<p>"Observing the restored Shikumen houses and narrow alleys has sparked
my interest in architectural heritage, and allowed me to reflect on the
importance of cultural preservation." - Png Wen Yu</p>
<p></p>
<p>"When we joined the lesson with the other students, I quickly realised
there would be challenges with language and communication style. This experience
taught me that it's important to seek support rather than struggle alone,
especially in unfamiliar situations." - Chin Zhi Teng</p>
<p>
<br>"I was deeply impressed by how Hema has integrated technology with traditional
retail seamlessly. It's a hybrid of e-commerce, logistics, and customer
experience management, offering convenience, personalisation, and efficiency."
- Alythea Yeoh</p>

<p>This successful trip equipped our students with valuable global perspectives
