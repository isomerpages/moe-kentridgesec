<p>The journey began in Amed, a coastal region known for its scenic black-sand
beaches and rich cultural traditions. At the <strong>Amed Salt Centre</strong>,
students learned about the traditional salt-making process that has sustained
local livelihoods for generations. Through hands-on participation, they
gained a deeper appreciation of Bali’s cultural heritage and reflected
on the importance of preserving traditional practices amidst modernisation.</p>
