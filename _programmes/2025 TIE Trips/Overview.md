<p>At Kent Ridge Secondary School, we believe that learning extends beyond
the classroom. This year, three internationalisation trips to Hanoi, Shenzhen
and Bali provided authentic opportunities for students to explore new environments,
broaden perspectives and develop global mindedness. These experiences nurtured
empathy, adaptability and a sense of shared humanity, enriching students’
understanding of the world and inspiring them to lead with compassion,
curiosity and a spirit of adventure, going Beyond Frontiers.</p>
