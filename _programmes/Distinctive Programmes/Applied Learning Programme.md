The School’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in “**Computational Thinking through Robotics**” will provide learning opportunities for students to apply their knowledge and skills in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics and to solve real-world problems.  This programme is aligned to Singapore’s initiative to build a Smart Nation and helps to better prepare our students for the future economy.

**ALP Outcomes**

The outcomes of ALP are aligned with the Kent Ridgean Outcomes of nurturing every Kent Ridgean to be a Gracious Citizen, a Passionate Learner, and a Resilient Leader. The desired outcomes are to enable Kent Ridgeans to

*   work well with peers in a respectful manner to share responsibilities and make sound decisions to present robotics-related solutions;
*   apply computational thinking skills, creative and inquisitive competencies in understanding and solving real-world issues using robotics-related solutions; and
*   display adaptability and resilience in the face of challenges when working in teams on robotics tasks.

**ALP Instructional Framework**

Our ALP instructional framework takes reference from the **Use-Modify-Create** Learning Progression and principles of **design thinking**. 

The Use-Modify-Create Learning Progression describes a pattern of engagement involving scaffolding increasingly deep interactions that can support and deepen the acquisition of computational thinking skills. During the “**Use**” phase, students learn how to use the technology, including the interface and tools. During the “**Modify**” phase, students begin to experiment by modifying existing programs / projects, making increasingly original contributions. Work at the “Use” and “Modify” phases builds foundation for higher levels of engagement with Computational Thinking. Hence Secondary 1 students are introduced to the basic functions of programming and robotics during the robotics proficiency programme. They are also given opportunities to build on their understanding and apply what they have learnt through mini projects.

During the “**Create**” phase, students apply their growing computational thinking skills to create an original product that meets the needs of a specific target audience. Work at this phase will show increasing levels of abstraction and automation. Over time, students will go through these phases to build their capacity to innovate and create **user-centric smart solutions** to solve real world problems. Hence Secondary 2 students are guided to apply what they have learnt across different knowledge domains, including what they have learnt during the robotics proficiency programme, to create an innovative, robotics-based solution to address a real world need using a design thinking process.

**ALP for Every Kent Ridgean**

All Secondary 1 students will experience the **Robotics Proficiency Programme** and all Secondary 2 students will continue to apply what they have learnt in **Project Work** to create user-centric smart solutions to solve real world problems. Specialised programmes are extended to students with passion and higher ability through our school’s Co-Curricular Activity – **InfoComm Club (Robotics)**, to further develop the students’ skills and competencies in computational thinking and robotics. Students are also given opportunities to participate in **Advanced Elective Modules** and **Elective Modules**.
