<h4><strong>Applied Learning Programme (ALP)</strong></h4>
<p>The school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) nurtures students to <strong>connect knowledge, empathy and innovation to design meaningful solutions for a sustainable future</strong>.
Grounded in the principles of environmental stewardship and aligned with
the Singapore Green Plan 2030, the programme engages students in authentic,
hands-on experiences that deepen their understanding of sustainability
and their role in shaping a greener future.</p>
<p><strong>Students learn that sustainability begins where they are, in the places they live, study and play</strong>.
At Kent Ridge, the Miyawaki Frontier (our mini-forest), Eco-Pond, and Sky
Garden serve as living laboratories that immerse students in studying biodiversity,
analysing water quality, and examining sustainable food systems. Through
these immersive spaces and community-based projects, they discover how
small actions can create ripples of positive change.</p>
<p>From exploring how everyday choices affect the environment to applying
technology for smarter green solutions and contributing to greening efforts
such as nurturing native trees and orchids, <strong>students develop a strong sense of pride, belonging and stewardship for Singapore’s natural heritage and shared future</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>ALP Outcomes</strong>
<br>Aligned with our school vision, <em>Heart of a Saint, Passion of an Inventor, Will of an Olympian</em>,
and student outcomes of nurturing every Kent Ridgean to be a <em>Gracious Citizen</em>, <em>Passionate Learner</em>,
and <em>Resilient Leader</em>, the ALP aims to develop students who:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>act with empathy and responsibility towards people and the environment;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>apply inventive thinking to design and implement purposeful sustainability
initiatives; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>demonstrate resilience and initiative in leading projects that inspire
positive change within and beyond the school.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br>These outcomes reflect the school’s commitment to empowering students
with the mindset, values and future-ready competencies to contribute meaningfully
to Singapore’s sustainable development.</p>
<p><strong>Our Approach to Sustainability Education</strong>
<br>The ALP adopts a whole-school approach to sustainability education that
integrates learning across subjects, school spaces and community partnerships.
It seeks to equip students with the knowledge, values and skills to take
action for a more sustainable future and to lead initiatives that promote
environmental stewardship.</p>
<p>Learning experiences are structured to move students from awareness to
action:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>In the<strong><em> Explore</em> </strong>phase, students learn about local
environmental issues and how human actions impact natural systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <strong><em>Apply</em> </strong>phase, they design and implement
initiatives that contribute to a more sustainable school and community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the<strong> <em>Lead</em></strong> phase, they take ownership of projects
that inspire collective action and positive change.
<br>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Through this progression, students develop head, heart, and hands, building
the <strong>confidence</strong>, <strong>empathy</strong>, and <strong>agency </strong>to
become active contributors to a sustainable and inclusive Singapore.</p>
