<p>The Learning for Life Programme (LLP) harnesses the transformative power
of sports and outdoor education to cultivate well-rounded leaders at Kent
Ridge Secondary School. Through carefully designed experiential learning
opportunities, students develop essential leadership capabilities grounded
in Kouzes &amp; Posner's research-based framework whilst building critical
21st century competencies.</p>
<p>The programmes (such as Kent Ridge Olympics, and Student Leadership camp)
creates authentic contexts where students learn to lead themselves, guide
their peers, and contribute meaningfully to their school and broader community.
By combining physical challenges with reflective practice, students emerge
as confident, resilient leaders equipped with the adaptive thinking, communication
skills, and global awareness needed to thrive in an interconnected world.</p>
