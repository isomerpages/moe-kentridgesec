### Arts Enrichment

In line with the school’s thrust on holistic education, Kent Ridge aims to inculcate in students an appreciation for the arts. Students take part in a range of arts enrichment programmes which expose them to various art forms. These include workshops that nurture students’ creativity in producing pieces using batik, metal tooling and ceramics. Students also discover their musical talents through workshops on the guitar and the ukulele.
