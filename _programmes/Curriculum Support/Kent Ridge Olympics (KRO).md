The theme for KRO 2019 is ‘Teamwork Makes the Dream Work’. A newly-added component to the competition was an Instagram Challenge and students were encouraged to upload photos which showcased Teamwork and sportsmanship. On 5 July, competitors of the five houses gave their best in the various games while supporters in the hall rocked the sports hall with their thunderous cheers. Teachers and parents engaged in a friendly game of Captain’s Ball and the teachers emerged victorious. Despite intense competition from the various houses, Cassiopeia House nearly made a clean sweep by winning the overall champion house, the cheer competition and the Instagram challenge. Not to be outdone, Auriga House impressed the judges with their fabulous mascot and won the Mascot Competition. It was a fun and memorable event for all, and the other houses look forward to coming back stronger in 2020.
