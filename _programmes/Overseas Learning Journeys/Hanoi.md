Led by a team of 3 teachers, a group of 21 Secondary 3 Normal Technical students embarked on an Overseas Service Learning Trip to Hanoi, Vietnam in November 2018. Preparation work started way back in September and prior to the trip, the team prepared lesson materials, engaging activities and outdoor games for 120 students from Sai Son Primary School.

However, on the first day of arrival at the school, they were informed that the local Principal would like them to engage the entire school of 1000+ students. The team had to think out of the box, adjust their plans and work as a team to do their best to interact, befriend and engage all the students. Besides bringing joy to the local children, they also helped to paint three mural walls for Sai Son Primary School's new school site. On their last day of Service Learning, the team presented a memorable farewell ceremony comprising of three entertaining performances for the entire school.

The students demonstrated sincerity in making a positive difference to the local community and they stayed resilient in overcoming all the unexpected challenges. Throughout the process, they have stay close-knitted as a team to Lead, Learn and Serve!
