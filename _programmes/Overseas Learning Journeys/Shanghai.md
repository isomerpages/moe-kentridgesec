**Shanghai Twinning Programme**

An exchange programme in which our students are immersed in a different environment through classroom learning and short homestay with their counterparts in Shanghai, China. They also visit places of interests to get a taste of the richness of Chinese history, culture and traditions. Our students also hosted their counterparts when they visit Singapore and KRSS.

Through this programme, we hope to increase their knowledge of the world beyond Singapore and to allow them to evaluate what it means to call themselves, Singaporeans and to increase theirs sense of belonging to Singapore. It also helps our students to be good hosts to the visitors.
