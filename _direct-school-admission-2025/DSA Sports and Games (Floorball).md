<p>Kent Ridge Secondary School will offer DSA to eligible students via Floorball,
Badminton and Basketball. This is in line with our Learning for Life Programme
which harnesses the philosophy of Olympism to develop our students through
the interaction of mind, body and will.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong>
<br>Floorball is an indoor sport that requires speed, agility, fitness and
teamwork. It is an exciting sport to play due to its speed and variability.</p>
<p>KR Floorball started in 2008 with a humble cohort of 36 enthusiastic students,
all of whom have little or no background in the sport. However, the CCA
gradually grew in strength over the years and we have now a total of 100
students. The Floorball has now begun to be recognized as a formidable
team in the tournament with several current students and alumni representing
external clubs.</p>
<p>The CCA-Floorball programme has proven to be an effective way to help
our students develop personal qualities such as teamwork, self-discipline
and leadership skills. Both our boys’ and girls’ teams compete in the National
‘B’ and ‘C’ Division competitions. Our players are trained by professional
coaches, supported by a strong group of dedicated alumni, who are passionate
about raising the standard of the sport in the school.</p>
