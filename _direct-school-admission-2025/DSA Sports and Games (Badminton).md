<p>Kent Ridge Secondary School will offer DSA to eligible students via Floorball,
Badminton and Basketball. This is in line with our Learning for Life Programme
which harnesses the philosophy of Olympism to develop our students through
the interaction of mind, body and will.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong>
<br>KR Badminton is a racquet sport played indoors. Although it may be played
with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with
one player per side) and "doubles" (with two players per side). It is a
sport that demands excellent fitness where players require&nbsp;aerobic
stamina,&nbsp;agility, strength, speed, and precision. It is also a technical
sport, requiring good&nbsp;motor coordination&nbsp;and the development
of sophisticated racquet movements</p>
<p>Our CCA-Badminton curriculum is designed to nurture our students’ talents
and potential to the fullest. This will encourage our students to develop
a lifelong interest and passion that will sustain a healthy lifestyle.</p>
<p>Apart from building up the physical fitness, mental fortitude and game
skills of our students, the badminton training sessions and co-curricular
activities undergirded by the school values, are also good platforms for
our students to develop positive character traits which will strengthen
their 21st&nbsp;century competency skills and translate into positive attitudes
and self-expressions.</p>
