notification: Kent Ridge Secondary School will serve as a polling station on
  polling day, 1 Sept 2023.  As part of the preparations for the school to be
  used as a polling centre, the school will be closed at 10.30am on 31 Aug,
  Thursday after the school's Teachers' Day Celebration.  We regret to share
  that we will be unable to host guests and alumni on that day. We invite all
  alumni and well-wishers to instead send teacher's day messages through the
  KRSS social media accounts.  Stay tuned for further details, which will be
  shared via our Instagram and Facebook pages!
