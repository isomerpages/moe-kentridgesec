A number of our Sec 2 and 3 students took part in the Singapore Amazing Flying Machine Competition this year.  Through months of training leading up to the competition, students have exemplified the school's FIRE values, never giving up and using every setback as an opportunity to learn and improve on their gliders and drones.  They live out the spirit of scientific inquiry as they apply what they have learnt in Science, troubleshooting and perfecting their products, while working in teams.  Everyone is a winner!

We are also very happy to share that one of our teams have emerged victorious, attaining two awards. They built an unpowered glider that was awarded Cat B Best in Performance and Cat B First Runner Up.  Last Saturday, they were invited to demonstrate their glider's flight to the Guest of Honour at the prize presentation ceremony.  Congratulations!
