A team consisting of three Sec 4/5 students participated in the 2021 Financial Literacy for Youths (FLY) Race organised by Republic Polytechnic. They had to conduct research and present on how individuals could help our hawkers to be sustainable yet financially viable. Our team emerged the 2nd runner-up. You have done us proud!
