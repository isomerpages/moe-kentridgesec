The Second Minister for Education and Foreign Affairs, Dr Maliki Osman, paid us a visit on 11 Jan 2022. He interacted with students and teachers to find out how everyone was adjusting back to the routines of school. He shared his observation of how students were excited to get back to face-to-face activities such as CCAs and advised them to enjoy themselves while adhering to safety measures.
