Our school has clinched the Community in Nature (CIN) Schools Award 2022 (Merit). Our Butterfly Garden, virtual tour and the incorporation of the garden’s features into the school’s curriculum received accolades from judges. The team of teachers and students persevered through the pandemic period to conceptualise and help build the garden. Kent Ridgeans, let’s continue being actively involved in appreciating and protecting local biodiversity.
