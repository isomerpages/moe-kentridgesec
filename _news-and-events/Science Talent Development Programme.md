We had a mini graduation ceremony for our first batch of students from the Science Talent Development Programme, where our Principal, Mr Keh, presented the certificates of completion to the students.  This batch of students had initiated the school’s journey on food composting.  They were also deeply involved in Science competitions and research projects where they learnt more about scientific thinking skills, working as a team to overcome difficulties and communicating confidently.  Congratulations, and continue to inspire others through your passion in Science.
