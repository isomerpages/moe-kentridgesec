Recently, some of our Sec 3 and 4 students participated in various Applied Learning Modules at Ngee Ann Polytechnic and Institute of Technical Education. Conducted over 3 days, these modules gave students the opportunity to build on existing curricular subjects through applied learning. Students were also introduced to possible pathways in Post-Secondary Education Institutions. Our students had an engaging time at the institutes of higher learning and learnt many useful skills from their mentors!

The courses that students participated were: <br>
ApLM@ITE (Practical Energy &amp; Water Conservation) <br>
ApLM@ITE (A Taste of Art &amp; Science of Cooking) <br>
ApLM@ITE (Practical Energy &amp; Water Conservation) <br>
ApLM@Poly (Eyesight Matters - Common Causes &amp; Correction)
