To create an immersive environment for the learning of Mother Tongue Languages (MTL), we designate two weeks each year for the MTL Fortnight, during which a wide range of activities related to CL/ML/TL language and culture are conducted for students. The MTL Fortnight activities provide platforms for students to actively learn MTL and the associated culture to experience MTL as ‘a living language’. The objectives of Cultural Camp for Sec 2 Express & Normal Academic students are to provide an immersive environment for students to learn and use Chinese in a more in-depth manner, and to appreciate their respective MTL cultures through hands-on tasks such as Lion and Dragon Dance, Festive Drums and Wushu performances.
