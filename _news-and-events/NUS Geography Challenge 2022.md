Our Secondary 4 students – Beth Isabel Vicneswaran, Lee Yee Chen, Chew Yong Hao and Ng Yi Jia Davian participated in the 2022 NUS Geography Challenge organised by the NUS Department of Geography and the NUS Geographical Society. The competition required them to demonstrate the understanding of a wide range of contemporary geographical issues through a series of video assignments, quizzes, and application questions. A video created by them on homelessness in Singapore earned them a place in the competition’s semi-finals.
