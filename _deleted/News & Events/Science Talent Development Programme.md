We had a mini graduation ceremony for our first batch of students from the Science Talent Development Programme, where our Principal, Mr Keh, presented the certificates of completion to the students.&nbsp; This batch of students had initiated the school’s journey on food composting.&nbsp; They were also deeply involved in Science competitions and research projects where they learnt more about scientific thinking skills, working as a team to overcome difficulties and communicating confidently.&nbsp; Congratulations, and continue to inspire others through your passion in Science.
