As the COVID-19 pandemic is still affecting Singapore, the school is putting in place safe management measures for the purchase of textbooks and uniforms during the year-end school holidays:

Please [book an appointment slot](http://www.picktime.com/krss2021) for the purchase of books and uniforms.

**Please show the confirmation email at school entry.** \[For the safety of the staff and students, the school will not allow entry for parents/guardians and/or students who have not made appointments for their visits.\]

In addition to booking appointment slots for your visit, we also seek the co-operation of parents/guardians for the following:

1.  Visits to the school for purchases of books/uniforms should be made by only 1 student and/or 1 parent/guardian (Safe management guidelines)
2.  Students coming to the school should be in proper school attire (e.g. primary school uniform/PE attire with proper school shoes, no coloured hair)
3.  All visitors will have to follow safe distancing guidelines and register SafeEntry/TraceTogether when they visit the school.
4.  Please do not come to the school if you are unwell, issued isolation order, or have tested Ag+.
