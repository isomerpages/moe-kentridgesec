**Appeal for transfer for serious medical conditions: Medical Appeal Exercise (MAE)**

If you assess that Kent Ridge Secondary School is unable to accommodate your child’s physical health needs, you may appeal for a transfer. Appeals can be filed at the school’s general office in person by 12pm on Thursday, 23 December 2021.

Appeals will only be considered on exceptional basis for students with:

*   **Serious medical conditions**, such as chronic heart conditions or kidney problems.
*   **Severe physical impairments**, such as those requiring permanent use of a wheelchair.

All appeals must be accompanied by relevant supporting documents, such as medical reports, letters from doctors.

The appeal results will be released in early January.

**Students who are posted to KRSS but would like to seek a transfer OUT due to other (non-medical) reasons**

*   Refer to your preferred school’s website for more information.
*   You should still report to KRSS on 4 Jan 2022 if you do not hear from your preferred school by then
*   While awaiting reply from the other school, you will not need to purchase KRSS uniforms and books
