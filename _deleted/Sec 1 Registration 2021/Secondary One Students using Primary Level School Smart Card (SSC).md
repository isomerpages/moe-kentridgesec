All students entering Secondary One in January 2022 will be issued with a new Secondary Level School Smart Card (SSC). TransitLink will deliver the cards to secondary schools by **April 2022**.

While Secondary One students are waiting for their Secondary Level SSCs to be ready, they can continue to use their Primary Level SSCs for concessionary travel till **end-April 2022**. Students can still purchase the Bus Concession Pass (BCP) using their Primary Level SSCs but they would need to purchase the BCP for Secondary School students.
