1.  **Student Handbook** (to be issued when school starts)

3.  **An oral digital thermometer (ODT)** in working condition (a new ODT will be issued to all new Sec 1 students on the first day of school in a one-time exercise)
4.  **TraceTogether Token.** As contact tracing is TT-based for primary, secondary and JCCI, students are to carry their TT tokens with them in school at all times. Parents can collect TT tokens for their children from any Community Centre/Club. Singaporeans and Permanent Residents who are collecting their tokens for the first time can also request for the TT token to be delivered via post.
