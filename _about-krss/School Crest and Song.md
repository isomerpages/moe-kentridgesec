The Kent Ridge Secondary School logo consists of a torch with a banner bearing the school name and motto "Beyond Frontiers" placed below it. Each element contributes to the whole in symbolising the vision and values of the school.

The central image of the torch symbolises the will and drive of an Olympian. The shining yellow flames forming the letters "K" and "R" (Kent Ridge) reflect passion, enthusiasm and perseverance.

The blue ring bearing the school motto ties the graphical elements together producing unity and cohesiveness - desired qualities of the school.

Blue represents the character and stability of the students and institution while the white interior reflects purity of thought. The stately grey banner with the school name complements the two dominant colours - yellow and blue, projecting prestige and honour.


### School Song

<p style="text-align:center;">Kent Ridgeans we will strive and move beyond frontiers <br>  
Excelling in all our endeavours  <br>  
Never holding back  <br>  
Always enterprising to be the best that we can be </p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Resilient and determined to overcome setbacks <br> 
Improving and achieving greater heights <br>  
Dare to make a difference  <br> 
Giving all our best  <br> 
Earnestly in our lives </p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Searching for knowledge in our daily quest  <br>
Embracing our values too <br>
Caring for others moulding heart and mind <br>  
Seek to do it right the first time </p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> Come let us spread our gleams of light  <br>
Hand in hand we can create a better life  <br>
Our hopes and our dreams only can come true  <br>
Living the Kent Ridgean life </p>
