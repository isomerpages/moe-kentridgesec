Led by its chairman, Mr Ng Wee Meng, the School Advisory Committee (SAC) is an active and dedicated stakeholder in the Kent Ridge Community. Its other members are: Mr Ronson Choo (Member), Mr Pan Chuan Chih George (Member) and Mr Ng Lee Kwang (Member).

Apart from supporting the school through generous donations of time and money, the SAC manages the SAC Fund and also actively supports school events such as Awards Day. The school taps on the expertise and networks of the committed SAC members in areas that enhance school programmes.
