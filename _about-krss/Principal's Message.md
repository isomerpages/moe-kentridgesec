Dear Kent Ridgeans,

It gives me great pleasure to welcome you as we start another school year.

Education is a journey of self-discovery where students discover their talents, strengths and weaknesses, and form their moral compass. Our school is committed to providing a student-centric, values-driven education that will prepare you for the challenges of the 21st Century. We nurture the Heart, ignite the Passion and strengthen the Will for you to become persons of exemplary character. This is reflective of our School Vision for every Kent Ridgean to have the ‘_Heart of a Saint_’, ‘_Passion of an Inventor_’ and ‘_Will of an Olympian_’. We believe that this compelling vision will inspire and motivate you to do your best. The future is going to be very different and it will be one that none of us can predict with certainty. Hence, your journey here is important as you acquire the knowledge, skills, attitudes and values that will prepare you for life beyond secondary school.

Our theme for 2023 remains as ‘***Leaders of Character and Leaders of Learning***’.

As **_Leaders of Character_**, we first learn to lead ourselves and then lead others. We reflect regularly on our thoughts and actions and how they impact others around us. We constantly strive for outcomes that benefit the community and for the common good. Be gracious citizens who are honest, responsible and respectful. Show care to your peers, teachers and members of the Kent Ridge family. Be willing to serve the community and be proud members of the nation. Be resilient, determined and never give up in the face of challenges. Learn to work well in teams and be exemplary student leaders who demonstrate our school values of _Fitness_, _Integrity_, _Respect_ and _Excellence_.

As **_Leaders of Learning_**, enjoy your learning and Learn for Life. Harness technology to help you learn better. We will be embarking on a Personal Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) where every student will have your own computer for learning. The intent is for students to become self-directed learners who take ownership of their own learning, and collaborative learners who work with others to deepen their learning. Be fully engaged in your curricular and co-curricular pursuits, and experience progress and victory. Take setbacks as opportunities for learning and bounce back stronger. Be enterprising and have the desire to take on new challenges. Be open to new ways of learning and do not be afraid to ask questions or make mistakes. Be confident in sharing your ideas and thoughts, and seek to develop yourself holistically. Enjoy the myriad of programmes that our school provides and always be passionate and willing to develop yourself fully.

In welcoming 2023, give your best in all your endeavours and success will be within your reach. Let us take Kent Ridge Secondary, **_Beyond Frontiers_!**

Warm regards,

Mr Benedict Keh  
Principal
