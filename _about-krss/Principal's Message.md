Dear Kent Ridgeans,

I am delighted and honoured to be appointed as the 5th Principal of Kent Ridge Secondary School, a school of distinctiveness with a strong foundation in academic learning and innovation.

As we embark on this new school year, let us approach it with unwavering determination and a spirit that embodies the virtues of a saint, the passion of an inventor, and the will of an Olympian. The journey ahead may seem challenging in view of the current landscape, but it is through facing and overcoming these challenges that we truly grow and succeed. As we strive to become a better self in the coming year, let us be guided by the school vision always.

**Heart of a Saint:** Channel the compassion, empathy, and kindness of a saint as you navigate the complexities of academic and social life. Extend a helping hand to your peers, support one another, and foster a community where everyone feels valued and included. Embrace the opportunity to make a positive impact on those around you, creating a school environment that reflects the best of yourself and humanity.

**Passion of an Inventor:** Approach your studies with the boundless curiosity and the creativity of an inventor. Treat each lesson as a canvas for innovation and exploration. Seek new perspectives, question the status quo, and discover the joy of learning. Embrace challenges as opportunities to showcase your inventive spirit, and let your passion drive you towards excellence in every endeavor.

**Will of an Olympian:** The road to success is paved with hard work, perseverance, and the indomitable will to overcome obstacles. Embody the determination of an Olympian athlete as you tackle academic demands and navigate the technological avalanche of information. Set ambitious goals, break them down into manageable steps, and celebrate every small victory on your journey to greatness.

In the midst of the academic pursuits and technological advancements, do not forget the importance of maintaining meaningful connections with your peers. Navigating friendship issues can be challenging, but with open communication, empathy, and a commitment to understanding one another, you can build lasting bonds that enhance your overall school experience.

Remember, you are not alone on this journey. The challenges you face are opportunities for growth and self-discovery. Embrace them with enthusiasm, knowing that each obstacle overcome brings you closer to your goals.

Wishing you a school year filled with wisdom, joy, and success. May the heart of a saint, the passion of an inventor, and the will of an Olympian guide you on this incredible journey.

With great anticipation and support,<br>
Mdm Valerie Goh<br>
