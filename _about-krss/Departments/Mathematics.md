### Overview

The Mathematics Department aims to develop every Kent Ridgean as a confident and competent problem solver. We seek to provide windows of opportunities for students to plan, act, reflect and grow in their problem-solving competencies both during formal lessons as well as through enrichment programmes and alternative assessments such as:
