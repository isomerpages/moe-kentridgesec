### Programmes

**Mathematics Mentoring Programme**

This is in collaboration between Kent Ridge Secondary School and tertiary institutions where a group of students coach selected Kent Ridge students in Mathematics on a weekly basis. It aims to provide additional support to students who are weak in the subject and demonstrate a desire to improve. For this programme, Kent Ridge has collaborated with Hwa Chong Institution, National University of Singapore and Singapore Management University.

**Bridging Programme for Foundation Mathematics students**

Foundation Mathematics students are given additional support in the form of small group teaching on a weekly basis on top of the normal curriculum.

**Pi Programme**

High Progress students are given opportunities to represent the school in external competitions/enrichment activities. Training will be provided and these learning experiences will augment well with their learning of mathematics.

**Mathematics Trail**

To make Mathematics more alive and relevant, every student in KRSS will have the opportunity to go to one Mathematics Trail in their four or five years of Secondary School education.

The Trail will also hone their collaboration, problem-solving and communication skills.
