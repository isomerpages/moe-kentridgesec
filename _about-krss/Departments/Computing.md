<h4><strong>Value of Computing</strong></h4>
<p>The rapid advancement of technology and growing capabilities of Artificial
Intelligence (AI) will bring about significant changes to the way we learn,
work and play. Companies must embrace digital transformations to survive
and strive and individuals must learn new digital skills to remain relevant.
Computing subjects provide upstream support for this effort by providing
students with opportunities to explore the field and satisfy their natural
curiosity about the technology around them. Students who offer Computing
subjects develop Computational Thinking skills and acquire useful digital
competencies that will be relevant in whatever fields or careers they pursue.</p>
<h4><strong>Vision of the KRSS Computing Department</strong><br></h4>
<p><em>Kent Ridgeans who are self-directed computational thinkers and competent and ethical computer users.</em>
<br>
<br>The KRSS Computing Department empowers students to become self-directed
computational thinkers and ethical computer users. We provide a rigorous
yet engaging curriculum that develops essential skills in understanding,
creating, and evaluating computational solutions. Our students learn to
analyze complex problems, design innovative solutions, and collaborate
effectively in our digital world. By integrating real-world projects and
emphasizing ethical considerations, we nurture critical thinking, adaptability,
and responsible digital citizenship. Our goal is to prepare Kent Ridgeans
not just for careers in technology, but to be confident, competent leaders
who can harness the power of computing to make positive impacts in any
field they choose.</p>

<h4><strong>Learning Experiences</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Learning Through Doing</strong>
<br>Students engage in hands-on experiences to design and create digital and
computational artefacts. In G1 Computing, students work with various digital
media tools to create vector and raster graphics, engaging presentations,
and videos. They also learn to use spreadsheets for data processing and
analysis. Building on these skills, students create games using Scratch,
developing fundamental programming concepts through block-based programming.
G3 Computing students focus on more advanced computational thinking, developing
complex programs using Python and performing in-depth data analysis with
spreadsheets. We foster collaborative learning through platforms like Google
Colab in G3 Computing, allowing students to work together on programming
projects in real-time, mirroring real-world development processes.</p>
<p><strong>Problem-Driven Approach</strong>
<br>We challenge students with authentic, real-world problems that require
computational solutions. This approach helps students develop critical
analytical skills as they learn to understand and extract key information
from problem statements. Students in both G1 and G3 Computing tackle age-appropriate
challenges. G1 students might design interactive games, create digital
media projects, or use spreadsheets to solve real-world data problems.
G3 students could develop complex algorithms, create advanced data analysis
tools using spreadsheets and Python, or tackle intricate programming challenges.
They learn to approach problems systematically, using techniques like decomposition
to break down complex issues and generalization to apply solutions across
similar problems. An important aspect of this approach is debugging, where
students examine code to identify and correct errors, further enhancing
their problem-solving skills.
