<h3><strong>Principles of Accounts</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Value of POA</strong>
</p>
<p>POA helps students understand how businesses measure and communicate their
performance and make use of both accounting and non-accounting information
related to their businesses to make decisions. By learning how to prepare,
present and communicate accounting information in a useful manner and make
decisions using the information, students acquire transferrable skills
such as organising and analysing information for decisionâˆ’making and applying
them in their daily lives. Students will also understand the importance
of values such as integrity and being objective and be guided by these
values when communicating information and making decisions.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Vision of POA&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><em>Kent Ridgeans who are meticulous and organised in preparing accurate accounting information and confident in analysing and communicating information in a useful manner that can be understood by others.&nbsp;</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>We aim to develop students into careful and systematic financial information
handlers. We provide a structured curriculum that builds essential skills
in preparing, analyzing, and presenting accounting information. Our students
learn to maintain accurate financial records, evaluate business performance,
and communicate financial concepts clearly. Through practical exercises
and case studies, we cultivate attention to detail and analytical thinking.
We also emphasize the ethical aspects of accounting to foster responsible
practices.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>To make the subject come alive, we offer our students multiple opportunities
for rich learning experiences. These include authentic tasks that mirror
real-world accounting scenarios, participation in interactive accounting
games, and engagement in enrichment programmes. We also encourage students
to participate in accounting competitions, allowing them to apply their
skills in challenging contexts beyond the classroom. These diverse experiences
not only reinforce theoretical knowledge but also develop practical skills
and foster a genuine interest in the field of accounting.</p>

<h3><strong>Elements of Business Skills</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Value of EBS</strong>
</p>
<p>Elements of Business Skills (EBS) provides students with foundational
business knowledge, transferable employability skills and values that will
enable them to succeed in future areas of study and work. Through EBS,
students learn about basic business activities, marketing, and customer
relations in the context of Singapore's travel and tourism, hospitality
and retail industries. By studying real-world business scenarios and conducting
business investigations, students develop critical thinking and decision-making
skills. They also cultivate an enterprising mindset as they analyze business
challenges and opportunities. EBS helps students understand business concepts
and practices that are relevant to their daily lives as consumers and potential
future employees or entrepreneurs.</p>

<p><strong>Vision for EBS</strong>
</p>
<p><em>Kent Ridgeans who are anchored in values, with foundational business knowledge and transferable employability skills in the service industry i.e. Travel and Tourism, Hospitality and Retail.</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>We aim to develop students into value-driven, business-savvy individuals
prepared for the dynamic service industry. Our curriculum provides a strong
foundation in business fundamentals, marketing principles, and customer
service skills contextualized to Singapore's key service sectors of travel
and tourism, hospitality, and retail. Through experiential learning approaches
like case studies, role-plays and business investigations, we cultivate
analytical thinking, problem-solving abilities and an innovative mindset
in our students, while emphasizing the importance of values and ethics
in business practices.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To bring business concepts to life, we offer our students learning experiences
beyond the classroom. These include learning trails around the neighbourhood,
where students examine real-world examples of retail mix and other business
concepts in action. We also organize learning journeys to local businesses
in the service industry and provide opportunities for students to develop
business proposals relevant to travel, tourism, hospitality, or retail.
These experiences help reinforce theoretical knowledge, develop practical
skills, foster interest in the service industry, and reinforce the values
that anchor our students' approach to business.</p>
