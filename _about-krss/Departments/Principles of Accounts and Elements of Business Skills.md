### Overview

Our dedicated teachers aim to develop our students to become competent preparers and confident communicators of accounting information who use both accounting and non-accounting information wisely for decision-making.

Our students are given multiple opportunities to have rich learning experiences through authentic tasks, participation in games, enrichment programmes and competitions to make the subject come alive.
