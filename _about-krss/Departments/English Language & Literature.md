### Overview

The EL and Literature Department aims to develop every Kent Ridgean as a life-long inquirer, an empathetic communicator and a passionate learner of Language and Literature.

We explore student-centric pedagogy such as Writing as a Process to help our students to develop metacognitive awareness in their writing. We also make use of ICT tools such as the Google Classroom and SLS to promote self-directed and collaborative learning in the classroom.

The department also seeks to provide platforms for students to demonstrate skills and attributes beyond pen and paper assessment. Our alternative assessment is planned for students to develop a range of skills over the course of three years:

Secondary 1: Video production (English)

Secondary 2: Drama (Literature)

Secondary 3: Current Affairs Presentation (English & Literature)

Students also have an opportunity to showcase their alternative assessment to the school through the Speak Up, Speak Out, Speak Right (SÂ³) Programme.
