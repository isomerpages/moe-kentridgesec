The EL and Literature Department aims to develop every Kent Ridgean as a life-long inquirer, an empathetic communicator and a passionate learner of Language and Literature.

**Customised Curriculum and Holistic Assessment**  
We seek to provide platforms for students to demonstrate skills and attributes beyond pen and paper assessment. Our alternative assessment is planned for students to develop a range of skills over the course of three years:

Secondary 1: Video production

Secondary 2: Drama

Secondary 3: Current Affairs Presentation

**Student-centric Pedagogy**  
Students learn through Writing as a Process to develop metacognitive awareness in their writing. They learn collaboratively using their Personal Learning Devices (PLDs), tapping on ICT tools including SLS, Google Classroom, Kami and Padlet.
