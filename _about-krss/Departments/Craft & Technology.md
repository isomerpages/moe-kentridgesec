strive for continual improvement and have a deep appreciation of design,
food science and the aesthetics.</p>

<br>Besides providing understanding of visual elements, aesthetics, and skills
in handling various media and conceptual tools, our Art students in KRSS

to protect and preserve the environment.</p>
