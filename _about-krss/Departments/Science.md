In line with MOE’s revised Science Curriculum Framework, the vision of the department is for every child to be an inquirer, supported by every teacher as a facilitator of the inquiry process.

We believe that every child can learn, and that Science is best learnt through a multi-modal approach.  Through the four or five years of Science education with us, students will

*   Develop a scientific literate mind, being equipped with sufficient knowledge and skills, and have the relevant values, ethics and attitudes to make informed decisions and take responsible actions in their lives.
*   Be equipped with strong Science fundamentals to innovate and pursue STEM for future learning and work.

The 5E instructional model, developed by the Biological Science Curriculum Study, is used by teachers as the key pedagogical approach.
