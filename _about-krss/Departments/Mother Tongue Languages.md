<p>Competitions</p>
<p><strong>Conversational Chinese/ Malay (CCM):</strong>
<br>CCM is introduced as an enrichment programme for non-Chinese / non-Malay
students who are interested in learning Chinese / Malay Language and its
culture. Communication through languages enhances social interaction. CCM
provides these students with the platform to communicate with their counterparts,
and to better understand and appreciate Chinese / Malay cultures and values.
It will also help students to enhance their rapport with Chinese- / Malay-speaking
friends</p>
<p><strong>MTL Translation Activities:</strong>
<br>The school translation programme develops students' bidirectional translation
skills between English and their Mother Tongue Language (Chinese or Malay),
supporting 21st Century Competencies. Students learn to navigate challenging
tasks while mastering appropriate language registers in both formal and
casual contexts. Throughout the year, students participate in translation
competitions and an Amazing Race at Changi Airport where mixed groups complete
translation tasks and solve riddles. Through these engaging activities,
students develop effective cross-cultural communication skills in both
languages.</p>

<p><strong>Malay Ambassador Programme (Rakan Bahasa):</strong>
<br>In collaboration with the Bulan Bahasa Committee, the school selects two
Rakan Bahasa (Malay Language Ambassadors) annually to serve as ambassadors
for the Malay language. This programme aims to enrich students' love and
appreciation for the Malay language while developing their leadership skills.
The appointed Rakan Bahasa participate in various language promotion activities
throughout the year, helping to foster a vibrant Malay language learning
environment within the school community.</p>
