### Overview
The Student Development Team, comprising of the CCE Committee, Student Leadership and Discipline Committe, SEN Committee and the Year Heads support the realisation of the school’s vision and key strategic thrust of Holistic Development of students through its approach of explicit teaching and experiential learning.

### CCE Curriculum

##### **Character and Citizenship Education Curriculum <br>Explicit Teaching**

**1.**&nbsp;**Character and Citizenship Education Lessons**  
Lessons are taught weekly with the aim of achieving the&nbsp;**four**&nbsp;enduring CCE 2021 goals. With CCE 2021, we aim to develop our students with:

a. Good Character: anchored in sound values, be able to think critically, ethically and to make discerning judgments and take responsibility for choices and actions 
<br>
b. Resilience and Well-Being: to remain resilient when facing challenges and are able to form healthy relationships and have a sense of gratitude which will contribute to their well-being 
<br>
c. Active Citizenship: students stepping up to contribute to people around them and the nation as well as 
<br>
d. Future Readiness: students having a sense of purpose in their lives and to be equipped to take on the challenges of the future 

The CCE Curriculum Content is based on the&nbsp;**three**&nbsp;big ideas of Identity, Relationships and Choices. It comprises the learning of core values, social-emotional competencies, and citizenship dispositions, with a focus on developing a sense of purpose in our students. These fundamentals are woven across content areas of National Education (NE), Sexuality Education (SEd), Mental Health (MH), Education and Career Guidance (ECG), Cyber Wellness (CW), and Family Education (FE), in ways that are age-appropriate and meaningful for our students.

**3.**&nbsp;**Education and Career Guidance**  
Education and Career Guidance is a developmental process which facilitates the acquisition of knowledge, skills and values needed to make informed decisions at key education stages to successfully transit from school to further education or work. Through ECG, social emotional competencies and qualities of proactivity, adaptability and resilience are developed to prepare students for the demands of the future workplace. The ECG curriculum focuses on exploration and helps students understand themselves better and guide their exploration of different education and career pathways. 

Students learn to:

*   Be more aware of their skills, interests and abilities.
*   Manage relationships with people who have influence over their decisions.
*   Explore relevant courses of study.
*   Understand careers in different sectors.

The ECG curriculum is delivered as part of the Character and Citizenship Education syllabus. Students will receive at least four hours of ECG lessons each year.

Organised ECG Programmes include:

*  ECG counselling by ECG counsellor
*  Class/cohort-based ECG workshops by ECG counsellor
*  DPA, DSA, PFP, EAE talks for graduating classes by Institutes of Higher Learning
*  Learning journeys to Institutes of Higher Learning

**4\. Values in Action Programme – KR Gives Back**  <br>
The school’s Values in Action (VIA) Programme is learning experiences that support students’ development as socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community, through the learning and application of values, knowledge and skills. VIA fosters student ownership over how they contribute to the community. As part of VIA, students reflect on their experience, the values they have put into practice, and how they can continue to contribute meaningfully.

### Student Leadership and Discipline

##### **Student Leadership Overview**

Student Leadership and Discipline in KRSS is guided by the philosophy of “Every Kent Ridgean A Leader. Every Student Leader a Peer Support Leader”.

With this end in mind, the student leadership and discipline committee serves:<br><br>

### Discipline Committee
##### **Disipline Committee Overview**
As part of the broad-based leadership development for all Kent Ridgeans, discipline is seen as a means to an end to understand the required expectations. This will allow all Kent Ridgeans to understand and internalize the expectations as to allow them to manage themselves accordingly. <br>
With this intent, Kent Ridge Secondary adopts positive discipline and restorative practice as the whole school approach to setting expectations for all Kent Ridgeans. This drives the school in developing the following discipline philosophy:<br><br>
•	Students learn well when there is order and discipline. At the same time, they need care, encouragement and space to learn from mistakes and improve.<br>
• Discipline is an educative process, and the goal is to instil self-discipline and good character in students.<br>
•	Disciplinary measures serve as a proxy for consequences of the poor choices made. It is not punishment, and must be meted out fairly, firmly, and appropriately.
