### Overview
The Student Development Team, comprising the Student-Well-Being Committee, CCE Committee and Discipline Committee has the mission of “Moulding Character, Shaping Lives” to support the realisation of the school’s vision and key strategic thrust of Character and Citizenship Education through its approach of explicit teaching and experiential learning.

### CCE Curriculum

##### **Character and Citizenship Education Curriculum <br>Explicit Teaching**

**1.**&nbsp;**Character and Citizenship Education Lessons**  
Lessons are taught weekly with the aim of achieving the&nbsp;**four**&nbsp;enduring CCE 2021 goals. With CCE 2021, we aim to develop our students with:

a. Good Character: anchored in sound values, be able to think critically, ethically and to make discerning judgments and take responsibility for choices and actions 
<br>
b. Resilience and Well-Being: to remain resilient when facing challenges and are able to form healthy relationships and have a sense of gratitude which will contribute to their well-being 
<br>
c. Active Citizenship: students stepping up to contribute to people around them and the nation as well as 
<br>
d. Future Readiness: students having a sense of purpose in their lives and to be equipped to take on the challenges of the future 

The CCE Curriculum Content is based on the&nbsp;**three**&nbsp;big ideas of Identity, Relationships and Choices. It comprises the learning of core values, social-emotional competencies, and citizenship dispositions, with a focus on developing a sense of purpose in our students. These fundamentals are woven across content areas of National Education (NE), Sexuality Education (SEd), Mental Health (MH), Education and Career Guidance (ECG), Cyber Wellness (CW), and Family Education (FE), in ways that are age-appropriate and meaningful for our students.
