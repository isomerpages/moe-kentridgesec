<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The Student Development Team, comprising of the CCE Committee, Student
Leadership and Discipline Committe, SEN Committee and the Year Heads support
the realisation of the school’s vision and key strategic thrust of Holistic
Development of students through its approach of explicit teaching and experiential
learning.</p>
<h3>CCE Curriculum</h3>
<h5><strong>Character and Citizenship Education Curriculum <br>Explicit Teaching</strong></h5>
<p><strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Character and Citizenship Education Lessons</strong>
<br>Lessons are taught weekly with the aim of achieving the&nbsp;<strong>four</strong>&nbsp;enduring
CCE 2021 goals. With CCE 2021, we aim to develop our students with:</p>
<p>a. Good Character: anchored in sound values, be able to think critically,
ethically and to make discerning judgments and take responsibility for
choices and actions
<br>b. Resilience and Well-Being: to remain resilient when facing challenges
and are able to form healthy relationships and have a sense of gratitude
which will contribute to their well-being
<br>c. Active Citizenship: students stepping up to contribute to people around
them and the nation as well as
<br>d. Future Readiness: students having a sense of purpose in their lives
and to be equipped to take on the challenges of the future</p>
<p>The CCE Curriculum Content is based on the&nbsp;<strong>three</strong>&nbsp;big
ideas of Identity, Relationships and Choices. It comprises the learning
of core values, social-emotional competencies, and citizenship dispositions,
with a focus on developing a sense of purpose in our students. These fundamentals
are woven across content areas of National Education (NE), Sexuality Education
(SEd), Mental Health (MH), Education and Career Guidance (ECG), Cyber Wellness
(CW), and Family Education (FE), in ways that are age-appropriate and meaningful
for our students.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>CCE2021 Implementation</strong>
<br>Key SDEs are designed to achieve CCE Learning Outcomes and 21st Century
Competencies.</p>

<p><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Education and Career Guidance</strong>
<br>Education and Career Guidance is a developmental process which facilitates
the acquisition of knowledge, skills and values needed to make informed
decisions at key education stages to successfully transit from school to
further education or work. Through ECG, social emotional competencies and
qualities of proactivity, adaptability and resilience are developed to
prepare students for the demands of the future workplace. The ECG curriculum
focuses on exploration and helps students understand themselves better
and guide their exploration of different education and career pathways.</p>
<p>Students learn to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Be more aware of their skills, interests and abilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manage relationships with people who have influence over their decisions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explore relevant courses of study.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understand careers in different sectors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The ECG curriculum is delivered as part of the Character and Citizenship
Education syllabus. Students will receive at least four hours of ECG lessons
each year.</p>
<p>Organised ECG Programmes include:</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>4. Values in Action Programme – KR Gives Back</strong> 
<br>The school’s Values in Action (VIA) Programme is learning experiences
that support students’ development as socially responsible citizens who
contribute meaningfully to the community, through the learning and application
of values, knowledge and skills. VIA fosters student ownership over how
they contribute to the community. As part of VIA, students reflect on their
experience, the values they have put into practice, and how they can continue
to contribute meaningfully.
<br>
<br>The school’s KR Gives Back (KRGB) programme provides students with the
experiential learning opportunity through customised VIA level activities
to live out their values, skills and SE competencies.</p>

<h3>Student Management Committee</h3>
<p>Kent Ridge Secondary adopts positive discipline and restorative practice
as the whole school approach to setting expectations for all Kent Ridgeans.
This drives the school in developing the following student management philosophy:&nbsp;</p>
<p>• Students learn well when there is order and discipline. At the same
time, they need care, encouragement and space to learn from mistakes and
improve.</p>
<p>• Student management is an educative process, and the goal is to instill
self-discipline and good character in students.</p>
<p>• Disciplinary measures serve as a proxy for consequences of the poor
choices made. It is not punishment, and must be meted out fairly, firmly,
and appropriately.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The student management team believes in setting high expectations, and
providing high care and support for our students to achieve their aspirations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Setting High Expectations</strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every Kent Ridgean is capable
of growth and can be nurtured to become a gracious citizen.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every Kent Ridgean can be and is
a resilient leader.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Be it in managing self or leading others, KRSS does not compromise
on the expectations and standards we set for Kent Ridgeans. In our approach,
we must be cognisant of the unique aspirations, hopes and needs of each
Kent Ridgean and their circumstances. In helping them become best versions
of themselves and impactful leaders of others, we must set expectations
based on their aspirations, hopes and needs rather than standards we impose
on them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Providing High Care and Support</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A strong
culture of care which embraces diversity and inclusivity and characterised
by strong Teacher Student Relationship (TSR) and Peer Support and Relationship
(PSR).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Developing a culture of diversity and inclusivity through strong TSR and
PSR allows us to create opportunities for us to mentor, develop, challenge
and stretch Kent Ridgeans in different aspects of their behaviourial and
leadership journey. A key approach is helping Kent Ridgeans to form positive
support networks and focus on their growth. In KRSS, we provide various
support systems for all Kent Ridgeans to achieve their aspirations.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>School Based Consequences</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequences are used to serve as
a reminder of the poor choices made.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not punishment, and must be
meted out fairly, firmly, and appropriately.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; KRSS will consider appropriate disciplinary
consequences that account for the students’ specific needs and helps them
learn from the mistake.</p>

and information sessions designed to raise awareness and promote inclusion.
Students learn ways to be understanding, accepting, and helpful to peers
who face challenges in school. This year, we also organised activities
such as Purple Parade activation and autism awareness programmes to further
support our inclusive culture.</p>

support their children at home whilst fostering a collaborative partnership
between families and the school.</p>
