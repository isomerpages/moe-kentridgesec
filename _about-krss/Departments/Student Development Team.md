<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The Student Development Team, comprising of the CCE Committee, Student
Leadership and Discipline Committe, SEN Committee and the Year Heads support
the realisation of the school’s vision and key strategic thrust of Holistic
Development of students through its approach of explicit teaching and experiential
learning.</p>
<h3>CCE Curriculum</h3>
<h5><strong>Character and Citizenship Education Curriculum <br>Explicit Teaching</strong></h5>
<p><strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Character and Citizenship Education Lessons</strong>
<br>Lessons are taught weekly with the aim of achieving the&nbsp;<strong>four</strong>&nbsp;enduring
CCE 2021 goals. With CCE 2021, we aim to develop our students with:</p>
<p>a. Good Character: anchored in sound values, be able to think critically,
ethically and to make discerning judgments and take responsibility for
choices and actions
<br>b. Resilience and Well-Being: to remain resilient when facing challenges
and are able to form healthy relationships and have a sense of gratitude
which will contribute to their well-being
<br>c. Active Citizenship: students stepping up to contribute to people around
them and the nation as well as
<br>d. Future Readiness: students having a sense of purpose in their lives
and to be equipped to take on the challenges of the future</p>
<p>The CCE Curriculum Content is based on the&nbsp;<strong>three</strong>&nbsp;big
ideas of Identity, Relationships and Choices. It comprises the learning
of core values, social-emotional competencies, and citizenship dispositions,
with a focus on developing a sense of purpose in our students. These fundamentals
are woven across content areas of National Education (NE), Sexuality Education
(SEd), Mental Health (MH), Education and Career Guidance (ECG), Cyber Wellness
(CW), and Family Education (FE), in ways that are age-appropriate and meaningful
for our students.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>CCE2021 Implementation</strong>
<br>Key SDEs are designed to achieve CCE Learning Outcomes and 21st Century
Competencies.</p>

<p><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Education and Career Guidance</strong>
<br>Education and Career Guidance is a developmental process which facilitates
the acquisition of knowledge, skills and values needed to make informed
decisions at key education stages to successfully transit from school to
further education or work. Through ECG, social emotional competencies and
qualities of proactivity, adaptability and resilience are developed to
prepare students for the demands of the future workplace. The ECG curriculum
focuses on exploration and helps students understand themselves better
and guide their exploration of different education and career pathways.</p>

that support students’ development as socially responsible citizens who
contribute meaningfully to the community, through the learning and application
of values, knowledge and skills. VIA fosters student ownership over how
they contribute to the community. As part of VIA, students reflect on their
experience, the values they have put into practice, and how they can continue

<h3>Discipline Committee</h3>
<h5><strong>Disipline Committee Overview</strong></h5>
<p>As part of the broad-based leadership development for all Kent Ridgeans,
discipline is seen as a means to an end to understand the required expectations.
This will allow all Kent Ridgeans to understand and internalize the expectations
as to allow them to manage themselves accordingly.
<br>With this intent, Kent Ridge Secondary adopts positive discipline and
restorative practice as the whole school approach to setting expectations
for all Kent Ridgeans. This drives the school in developing the following
discipline philosophy:
<br>
<br>• Students learn well when there is order and discipline. At the same
time, they need care, encouragement and space to learn from mistakes and
improve.
<br>• Discipline is an educative process, and the goal is to instil self-discipline
and good character in students.
<br>• Disciplinary measures serve as a proxy for consequences of the poor
choices made. It is not punishment, and must be meted out fairly, firmly,
and appropriately.</p>
<h3>Student Support Programmes</h3>
<p><strong>1. Social and Emotional Well-being</strong> 
<br>Student support structures in this aspect include Individual Counselling
Support, Secondary 1 Transition &amp; Engagement Programme, Emotional Literacy
Programme and Secondary 4 Stress Management Programme.

to seek help.</p>
