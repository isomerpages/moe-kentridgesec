Kent Ridge Secondary School will offer DSA to eligible students via Floorball, Badminton and Basketball. This is in line with our Learning for Life Programme which harnesses the philosophy of Olympism to develop our students through the interaction of mind, body and will.

**Background**

Basketball is a sport that can be played in indoors and outdoors. Basketball has player positions where all players complement each other to outperform their opponents. It is a fast-paced and exciting game where there are many individual techniques for displaying skills such as ball-handling, shooting, passing, dribbling, shot-blocking and rebounding. All players are required to possess speed, agility, excellent dribbling and shooting skills.

The CCA-Basketball programme has proven to be an effective way to develop our ‘B’ and ‘C’ division players (boys and girls) to become determined, resilient and confident individuals. The provision of opportunities for our players to hone their leadership and game skills further complements the programme to develop 21st&nbsp;century competencies in our players. The Basketball programme also exposes students to different level of challenges and provides guidance from our dedicated, experienced and professional coaches.
